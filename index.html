Looking at the tendency to "see visions," C. Kerenyi examines the Mysteries of Eleusis from the standpoint not only of Greek myth but also of human nature. Kerenyi holds that the yearly autumnal "mysteries" were based on the ancient myth of Demeter's search for her ravished daughter Persephone--a search that he equates not only with woman's quest for completion but also with every person's pursuit of identity. As he explores what the content of the mysteries may have been for those who experienced them, he draws on the study of archaeology, objects of art, and religious history, and suggests rich parallels from other mythologies.</p></p><p>The Sanctuary of Eleusis, near Athens, was the center of a religious cult that endured for nearly two thousand years and whose initiates came from all parts of the civilized world.

This decisive period in Chinese history became a subject of intense and continuing interest to historians, poets, and dramatists. Writing some 1,200 years later, the Ming author Luo Guanzhong drew on this rich literary heritage to fashion a sophisticated, compelling narrative that has become the Chinese national epic. Luo&#39;s novel offers a startling and unsparing view of how power is wielded, how diplomacy is conducted, and how wars are planned and fought; it has influenced the ways the Chinese think about power, diplomacy, and war even to this day. As important for Chinese culture as the Homeric epics have been for the West, this Ming dynasty masterpiece continues to be widely influential in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, and remains a great work of world literature. The University of California Press is pleased to make the complete and unabridged translation available again.</p><p>"<i>The Three Kingdoms</i> gives us <i>The Iliad</i> of China. First of the five great works of traditional prose fiction, this master narrative transforms history into epic and has thereby educated and entertained readers of five centuries with unforgettable exemplars of martial and civic virtue, of personal fidelity and political treachery. Moss Roberts's translation, the first complete rendering in English, is one of surpassing excellence and impeccable scholarship. It should delight and captivate Western readers for many more years to come."&#x2015;Anthony C. Yu, University of Chicago <br><br> "Moss Roberts's elegant and powerful translation of China's most important historical romance has a stunning directness that aptly conveys the dramatic boldness of the original episodic narrative. English readers may now finally understand why this 15th-century novel so strategically shaped the political world-view of generations of Chinese."&#x2015;Frederic Wakeman, Director of the Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley<b>Luo Guanzhong</b> (c. 1330-c. 1400) was a novelist and dramatist who played an important role in the development of Chinese popular fiction. <b>Moss Roberts</b> is Professor of Chinese at New York University.

Hock,</b> PhD, is a professor of psychology and human sexuality at Mendocino College in northern California. He received his MA in Psychology from San Diego State University and his PhD in Psychology from the University of California at San Diego. He is also the author of <i>Forty Studies that Changed Psychology: Explorations into the History of Psychological Research</i> (Pearson, 2012) and coauthor (with Meg Kennedy Dugan) of <i>It&#x2019;s My Life Now: Starting over after an Abusive Relationship or Domestic Violence</i> (Routledge, 2006), and (with Amy Marin) <i>Psychology</i>, a digital introductory psychology textbook from Pearson Education.<br> <br>Dr. Hock has been teaching psychology and human sexuality for over twenty-five years. Human Sexuality is his favorite class to teach and is consistently one of the most popular among students. He believes that Human Sexuality is an essential course for college students because the topics covered are fundamental to our lives and our identities as humans. He asserts that the Human Sexuality course should be a requirement for all undergraduate college and university students. Why? Because the material in this course touches everyone, in countless ways, throughout their lives. But, more importantly, students, upon entering college as adults, often lack a complete and current understanding of at least some, if not many, key issues that combine to create the complexities of humans as sexual beings. Sex education in grades K&#x2014;12 tends to be incomplete, inadequate, sometimes misleading, and too often, nonexistent. Moreover, not all parents are willing or able to impart the necessary and correct information to their children. Students in higher education clearly need and deserve the knowledge they acquire in this class.</p><h2>Hannah Arendt: For Love of the World</h2><p>An in-depth biography of political philosopher Hannah Arendt traces her life from her childhood in Germany to her years in America, discussing the events and influences that shaped her work.</p><p><b>Elisabeth Young-Bruehl</b>, who now practices as a psychoanalyst in New York City, is on the faculty of the Columbia Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research."Young-Bruehl gives us the story of a woman so thoroughly of her time and circumstances that she epitomizes a historical moment. . . .

Hannah Arendt always knew the difference; her critics sometimes did. In the disparity lay the tragedies and consolations of a career still sparking debate 19 years after the appearance of her most controversial book."&#x2015;Stefan Kanfer, <i>Time</i> (on earlier edition)<br>"Young-Bruehl portrays the thinker's personal life and intellectual development within the context of the historical, political, and philosophical issues which informed Arendt's life and work. Insightful commentary on 20th-century philosophy, Jewish self-awareness, politics and moral thought after World War II, and Arendt's relationship to other thinkers and writers (including Heidegger, Jaspers, poets and editors) makes this a particularly well-rounded biographical study.

Smilen Present Tense Award for the best book in Biography/Autobiography (on the earlier edition)<br>"Elisabeth Young-Bruehl's <i>Hannah Arendt </i>is to be commended for its impressive mastery of twentieth-century central European history and its keen perception of the way events and philosophical probings coalesced in this displaced intellectual.

One of the guests notes an anomaly in the fabric of the venerable edifice: a blackened post that has been carefully built into a trim new window frame. Thereby hangs a tale, one that, as the wise old grandfather who has lived all his life in the house proceeds to tell it, takes one chilling turn after another, while his audience listens in appalled silence. Featuring a cruelly overbearing lord of the manor and the oppressed villagers who must render him service, an irreverent young woman who will stop at nothing, a mysterious stranger with a red beard and a green hat, and, last but not least, the black spider, the tale is as riveting and appalling today as when Jeremias Gotthelf set it down more than a hundred years ago. <i>The Black Spider</i> can be seen as a parable of evil in the heart or of evil at large in society (Thomas Mann saw it as foretelling the advent of Nazism), or as a vision, anticipating H. P. Lovecraft, of cosmic horror. There&#x2019;s no question, in any case, that it is unforgettably creepy.</p><p>Jeremias Gotthelf, the pen name of Albert Bitzius (1797&#x2013;1854), was a Swiss pastor and the author of novels, novellas, short stories, and nonfiction, who used his writing to communicate his reformist concerns in the field of education and with regard to the plight of the poor. After the success of his first novel, <i>Der Bauernspiegel oder Lebensgeschichte des Jeremias Gotthelf: Von ihm selbst beschrieben</i> (The Peasants&#x2019; Mirror; or, The Life History of Jeremias Gotthelf: Described by Himself; 1836) the author adopted the name of the story&#x2019;s protagonist. Among his major works to have appeared in English translation are <i>The Black Spider</i>; <i>Ulric, the Farm Servant</i>; and <i>The Story of an Alpine Valley</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Susan Bernofsky is the translator of six books by Robert Walser as well as works by Jenny Erpenbeck, Yoko Tawada, Hermann Hesse, Gregor von Rezzori, and others. The current chair of the PEN Translation Committee, she teaches at the Writing Program at Columbia University, where she is director of the Graduate Translation Program, and is at work on a biography of Walser."Gotthelf spins his horrifying tale patiently, serenely, with full confidence, it seems, that it will be strong enough to bear all the allegorical weight he can load on it. His confidence is justified. <i>The Black&nbsp; Spider </i>is scary as hell, and the evil it portrays with such apparent simplicity seems, in the end, a more complex phenomenon than we might have thought....He does something only the best horror writers, and the best preachers, can do: he puts the fear of God in you." &#x2014;Terrence Rafferty, <i>The New York Times Book Review<br></i><br>&#x201c;There is scarcely a work in world literature that I admire more.&#x201d; &#x2014;Thomas Mann<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>The Black Spider</i> was a horror story of its day, written by a Swiss pastor, Albert Bitzius, under the pseudonym of Jeremias Gotthelf. What distinguishes it from, say, the horror stories of Gotthelf&#x2019;s contemporary, Edgar Allan Poe, is that Gotthelf firmly believed in the reality of the demon he created.... Gotthelf&#x2019;s talent is to make his horror credible by the simplicity of his style and the acuteness of his psychological perception, particularly of the herd instinct among the villagers. His story is a homily, showing how the everyday moral weaknesses of men and women give an opening to the spirit of evil. Christine&#x2019;s sin is not just in flirting with the Devil, but in thinking that she knows best.&#x201d; &#x2014;Piers Paul Read, <i>The Times </i>(London)<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Jeremias Gotthelf: with him I&#x2019;m just like the woman in Heinrich Pestalozzi&#x2019;s novel <i>Lienhard und Gertrud</i> who says &#x2018;Your priest has driven me out of church!&#x2019; &#x201d; &#x2014;Robert Walser<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Perhaps the psychological theories of Freud and Jung and the nightmare fantasies of Kafka had to be absorbed before the European imagination was ready for Gotthelf&#x2019;s <i>The Black Spider</i>.&#x201d; &#x2014;Herbert Waidson, author of <i>Jeremias Gotthelf: An Introduction to the Swiss Novelist</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Gotthelf&#x2019;s writings are the utterance of the earnest life within and around him. He entered into the great mountain temple of nature, following within the veil such great high-priests as Wordsworth and Novalis. He is a true poet when he tells us in hushed voice of the hill-side storm, the relentless avalanche, the devastating torrent; or leads us rejoicing through the jubilant spring woods and grateful autumn fields.

More than just financial rewards are at stake. Friendships and relationships can suffer. Bad decisions at the inception of a promising venture lay the foundations for its eventual ruin. <i>The Founder's Dilemmas</i> is the first book to examine the early decisions by entrepreneurs that can make or break a startup and its team.</p><br><p> Drawing on a decade of research, Noam Wasserman reveals the common pitfalls founders face and how to avoid them. He looks at whether it is a good idea to cofound with friends or relatives, how and when to split the equity within the founding team, and how to recognize when a successful founder-CEO should exit or be fired. Wasserman explains how to anticipate, avoid, or recover from disastrous mistakes that can splinter a founding team, strip founders of control, and leave founders without a financial payoff for their hard work and innovative ideas. He highlights the need at each step to strike a careful balance between controlling the startup and attracting the best resources to grow it, and demonstrates why the easy short-term choice is often the most perilous in the long term.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Founder's Dilemmas</i> draws on the inside stories of founders like Evan Williams of Twitter and Tim Westergren of Pandora, while mining quantitative data on almost ten thousand founders.</p><br><p> People problems are the leading cause of failure in startups.

Few entrepreneurs appreciate the far-reaching implications of decisions they need to make at the beginning of a startup venture. Most founders make these critical decisions based on their gut instincts; backed up by data covering ten thousand founders, Noam Wasserman shows that the most common choices made at the outset of a new venture are often the wrong ones. This book also shines a light on the difficult conversations that entrepreneurs need to have with their colleagues and with their investors, and makes plainspoken, commonsense recommendations that facilitate this dialogue."<b>--Pascal Levensohn, founding partner of Levensohn Venture Partners and member of the board of directors of the National Venture Capital Association (2007--2011)</b></p><p>"<i>The Founder's Dilemmas</i> will change the way we think about the internal dynamics that can make or break startup companies.

As we discovered at YouTube, those early decisions have far-reaching impacts and lead to unforeseen pitfalls down the road. Noam Wasserman uses vivid anecdotes and deep research to expertly outline the key early choices that define a startup, making <i>The Founder's Dilemmas</i> an invaluable alternative to real-world trial and error."<b>--Chad Hurley, founder-CEO of YouTube</b></p><p>"[A] wonderful book. . . .

The young heiress next busies herself with finding a suitable husband for her friend and prot�g�, Harriet Smith, setting off an entertaining sequence of comic mishaps and misunderstanding in this sparkling comedy of English-village romance. Beneath its considerable wit, the novel is also the story of a young woman's progress toward self-understanding.<br><i>Emma</i> abounds in the droll character sketches at which Jane Austen excelled. In addition to the well-intentional heroine and her hypochondriacal father, the village of Highbury during the Regency period is populated by an amusing circle of friends and family &#x2014; kindhearted but tedious Miss Bates, a chatterbox spinster; ambitious Mr. Elton, a social-climbing parson; Frank Churchill, an enigmatic Romeo; Mr. Knightley, Emma's brother-in-law and the voice of her better nature; and a cluster of other finely drawn, unforgettable personalities.<br>The author's skill at depicting the follies of human nature in a manner both realistic and affectionate elevates this tale of provincial matchmaking to the heights of scintillating satire. A classic of English literature that has delighted readers since its 1816 publication, the novel is now available in this high-quality, inexpensive edition sure to charm a new generation.</p><p></p></p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Aeneas to Augustus: A Beginning Latin Reader for College Students, Second Edition</h2><p>This reader consists of 90 selections illustrating the history of Rome from the myth of Aeneas to the founding of the Augustan Principate.

Strand, M.D., graduated from the University of Colorado Medical School and finished his post-graduate training at Mercy Hospital in San Diego, California. He has been involved in an active private family practice for the past thirty years, and has focused his practice on nutritional medicine over the past seven years while lecturing internationally on the subject. Dr. Strand lives on a horse ranch in South Dakota with his lovely wife, Elizabeth. They have three grown children.South Dakota-based Strand, a general practitioner for nearly a quarter century, turned his attention to nutrition in the mid-90s when traditional medical approaches failed to help his wife's chronic fatigue. In his authorial debut, Strand preaches vitamins, minerals, fatty acids and other nutritional supplements with the zeal of a new convert. His opponents are formidable: the government, food suppliers and the medical establishment who, Strand says, disregard evidence that the RDA recommendations are inadequate to supply us with the weapons to fight chronic diseases. Chapters cover "Oxidative Stress and Your Eyes," "Cellular Nutrition" and "Homocysteine: New Kid on the Block," among other ailments and panaceas. Despite the alarmist title, those who suffer from or are at risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer, auto-immune disorders and lung disease may want to weigh the evidence for themselves; Stand's book is designed to provide an alternative perspective that aids in doing so, though it also includes various supplemental regimens he has devised. His message, after all, is fundamentally a simple one: let's protect and care for our bodies, Strand says, and "may we all live until we die." <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Three Musketeers (Signet Classics)</h2><p><b>The classic adventure from the author of <i>The Count of Monte Cristo </i>and <i>The Man in the Iron Mask</i>.</b><br><br> In this swashbuckling epic, d&#x2019;Artagnan, not yet twenty, sets off for Paris in hopes of joining the Musketeers, that legion of heroes highly favored by King Louis XIII and feared by evil Cardinal Richelieu.

This is because, as he says, &#x201c;It is the Word of God and the work of God that changes people&#x2019;s lives.&#x201d;Chapter 1: Step In 1 STEP IN <br><i>A Starting Place on the Journey</i><br> <br>The will of God.<br> <br>We talk about it in church and our Christian circles enough. We hear repeatedly that the Lord has a plan for us and that it is good. We are instructed to seek it, embrace it, and live it. We are even told that it is the key to our future. But what is it? Even though God&#x2019;s will sounds like something we would like&#x2014;and even <i>need</i>&#x2014;to know, the whole idea of it often stirs up more questions than answers.<br> <br>After all, it is the <i>will</i>&#x2014;the volition that drives the workings of the universe, the paths of empires, and the lives of all peoples&#x2014;of <i>God</i>, of the all-knowing, all-powerful, unseen, indescribable Creator of all things. Who wouldn&#x2019;t want to be aware of such lofty information?<br> <br>Yet even those of us who have been believers a long time sometimes have mistaken ideas about what the will of God really is. Some think it is special knowledge or divine and mystical revelations that the Father gives to super-spiritual people, which is not true. Still others would admit that they shy away from God&#x2019;s will because they believe the Lord will ask them to do what they really don&#x2019;t want to do. They believe God&#x2019;s will is always difficult, sacrificial, or heartbreaking. That&#x2019;s not accurate, either.<br> <br>Sadly, whatever your view of it, God&#x2019;s will can seem grand and unreachable, can&#x2019;t it? In fact, after my many years in ministry, I have heard enough people talk about how frustrated they are about their Christian life that I am fully persuaded there&#x2019;s one ultimate reason: They do not understand the nature of the will of God, nor do they know how to find it. And if you don&#x2019;t understand those two things, you may feel insecure and directionless in your walk with Jesus. Both the small, daily pressures as well as the life-changing and overwhelming issues in life can make you feel as if you are under constant assault, lost, and helpless.<br> <br>Maybe that&#x2019;s what stirred your interest in this book. Certainly, it could be that you want to honor your Savior and stay on track with what He envisions for your life. After all, He created you and knows what He intended you to be. If He has a plan for your life, who wouldn&#x2019;t want to experience His very best?<br> <br>But that&#x2019;s not usually what drives people to seek God&#x2019;s will. Often there are questions about the future, decisions that must be made, or challenges that arise that have no foreseeable solution that drive us to our knees before the Father. Our only hope is the Lord&#x2019;s insight, intervention, and provision.<br> <br>In other words, perhaps you&#x2019;re interested in the topic of God&#x2019;s will because you are at a crossroad and have no idea which way to turn. Or maybe you&#x2019;re between a rock and a hard place and see no hope of escape.<br> <br>It also could be because you don&#x2019;t know why the Lord has waited so long to give you the desires of your heart. Is this longing part of His plan for you or isn&#x2019;t it?<br> <br>Or maybe you simply don&#x2019;t understand why certain hardships have befallen you.<br> <br>The problem is, of course, how do you seek out God&#x2019;s will? And how do you know for certain if you have heard Him correctly? There is an incredible level of frustration when you are desperate for the Lord&#x2019;s guidance, but heaven seems silent. We can get so discouraged that we are tempted to say, &#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t know how to find God&#x2019;s will, so what I&#x2019;m going to do is the best I can and hope it all works out.&#x201d;<br> <br>But understand, you merely &#x201c;wishing that everything will be all right&#x201d; is not the Father&#x2019;s intention. It&#x2019;s not His best. It&#x2019;s not the relationship He desires to have with you. He has a very specific plan for your life&#x2014;one that can and should inspire your complete confidence. He promises in Jeremiah 29:11: &#x201c;I know the plans that I have for you... plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope.&#x201d; This is the hope each and every one of us can cling to. God has plans for you and He knows how to accomplish them in the best, most effective way possible for your particular personality, giftedness, and future.<br> The Lord Is a Planner<p></p> <br>So right now, set your mind on this truth: <i>Our God is a planner.</i> He is not a reactor. He did not set this world in motion to be ruled by chance or wild, unchecked forces. Nor did He create you to live without hope and purpose.<br> <br>In fact, from before the beginning the Lord has been making plans for you and for me. Just think about how He created this world with a variety of landscapes, colors, animals, plants, foods, smells, and textures. He thought of everything we would ever need and innumerable objects and creatures to satisfy our needs, stir our imaginations, fascinate our minds, and give joy to our souls.<br> <br>Likewise, Ephesians 1:4 tells us God &#x201c;chose us in Him&#x201d;&#x2014;in Christ&#x2014;&#x201c;before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him.&#x201d; In other words, the Father knew you and I would have the problem of being separated from Him by our sin. He understood the pain and frustration you and I would feel at not being able to reach Him, interact with Him, and receive His love because of our fallen human state. Therefore, the Lord has been strategically unfolding His grand design to send a Savior Who would forgive our sin and restore our relationship with the One for Whom our souls most yearn. And He was careful about it&#x2014;God went to great lengths to show us <i>Who</i> would make us right with Him. Through the prophets, the Father began unveiling what He would do and He precisely pointed to Who our Savior would be&#x2014;each prophecy and revelation narrowing down the possibility of Who could fulfill His requirements.<br> <br>For example, Isaiah foretold: &#x201c;A virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel&#x201d; (Isa. 7:14). This may seem like an odd prerequisite for a Savior. However, Romans 5:12 tells us: &#x201c;Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned.&#x201d; At the Fall, all humanity received the sin nature&#x2014;every one of us is a sinner (Rom. 3:23). This is because the seed of the sin nature passes through our fathers. But this is also why the virgin birth was necessary&#x2014;without a human father, our Deliverer would not receive the sin nature.<br> <br>One would think this would be sufficient to distinguish Who the Savior would be. But the Lord knew that other religions would arise that would falsely declare that they were the way to Him&#x2014;and they would claim virgin births as well: Buddha, Krishna, the Egyptian deities Horus and Osiris, the Persian Mithra, the Aztec Quetzalcoatl, the Chinese Lao-Tsze, and others. So, in order to protect us from their false assertions, God narrowed the identification process further. The Anointed Savior, or <i>Messiah</i>, would be a fulfillment of the covenant to Abraham and come from his line (Gen. 12:3). And not only Abraham&#x2014;but a specific great-grandchild of Abraham named Judah.<br> <br>Abraham fathered Isaac; Isaac&#x2019;s wife, Rebekah, gave birth to twins, Jacob and Esau; and Jacob had twelve sons&#x2014;including a child named Judah. About Judah, Jacob prophesied, &#x201c;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler&#x2019;s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples&#x201d; (Gen. 49:10). The <i>scepter</i> was a symbol of kingship and authority, so Jacob was communicating that someone from the line of Judah would always be the ruler of Israel. Also, the word <i>Shiloh</i> means &#x201c;that which belongs to him.&#x201d; So Jewish scholars have taken Jacob&#x2019;s use of the word to refer to the Messiah&#x2014;that ultimately, Christ would come through Judah&#x2019;s line.<br> <br>Eventually, a monarch was born through Judah&#x2014;a man named David. Of course, David is one of Israel&#x2019;s most famous kings. But God restricted the possibilities of Who Christ would be even further when He told David, &#x201c;Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever&#x201d; (2 Sam. 7:16)&#x2014;indicating that the Redeemer would be his descendant. So the Messiah came to be known as the &#x201c;Son of David&#x201d; (Matt. 1:1).<br> <br>One after another, the Lord God provided incredible details about Who our Savior would be, where the Messiah would be born (Mic. 5:2), when He would appear (Dan. 9:25&#x2013;26), what He would do (Isa. 61), and even His main region of ministry (Isa. 9:1; Matt. 4:12&#x2013;17). Thousands of these prophecies revealed the only One Who could make us right with God&#x2014;and that is Jesus. And there would be only one sacrifice that He could make to fulfill the Lord&#x2019;s requirements, which was His death on the cross (Isa. 53).<br> Step into the Plan<p></p> <br>Why am I telling you all of this&#x2014;especially at the beginning of a book on God&#x2019;s will? Because if you will think about how precisely the Father has planned your redemption, your home in heaven, and your rewards&#x2014;you have to realize how deeply He treasures you and how carefully He thinks about your future. He wouldn&#x2019;t have gone to such lengths to provide for your salvation if He did not value you.<br> <br>Now think about this: Would God&#x2014;having been so specific in all of His planning&#x2014;suddenly just forget about you? Would He say, &#x201c;Live your life the best you can. Just do what you can with what you&#x2019;ve got&#x201d;? Of course He wouldn&#x2019;t. He made such an extraordinary and costly investment in you because He sees you&#x2019;re worth it. And He wants you to join Him in His great plan.<br> <br>In fact, what we see consistently throughout history is that the Father <i>wants</i> to reveal His will. He also shows us the way <i>into</i> His plan for each of us&#x2014;and that is through a relationship with Jesus. In every way, Jesus is the key that opens the door to understanding God&#x2019;s plan and it all begins by accepting Him as your Savior.<br> <br>If you have never received Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, it is no wonder that the whole concept of God&#x2019;s will is confusing to you. Many people think they can know the Lord&#x2019;s path for them without ever really knowing Jesus&#x2014;the One Who is His ultimate plan. Don&#x2019;t make that mistake. The Father&#x2019;s purpose for your life doesn&#x2019;t have to remain a mystery.<br> <br>So if no one has ever had the great and joyful privilege of helping you to receive Christ&#x2019;s gift of salvation, I pray you will allow me to do so now. All it takes is being willing to admit that you cannot overcome your sin on your own, but that you trust that the sacrifice Jesus made on the cross was sufficient to forgive everything you have ever done wrong. Are you willing? If so, you can tell Him in your own words or use this simple prayer:<br> <br><i>Lord Jesus, I come to You asking You to forgive my sins and save me from eternal separation from God. In faith, I accept Your work and death on the cross as sufficient payment for my transgressions. I also confess that You are Lord. Help me to turn from my sins and live in a manner that is pleasing to You.</i><br> <br><i>I praise You for providing the way for me to know You and to have a relationship with my heavenly Father. Through faith in You, I have eternal life and I trust You have prepared a home in heaven for me. I acknowledge that trusting You as my Savior is my first step into understanding and living out God&#x2019;s will.</i><br> <br><i>Thank You for hearing my prayers, loving me unconditionally, and leading me in God&#x2019;s plan. Please give me the strength, wisdom, and determination to walk in the center of Your will. In Jesus&#x2019; name, amen.</i><br> Beginning, End, and Everything in Between<p></p> <br>If you&#x2019;ve just received Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you&#x2019;ve just made the very best decision you will ever make! There is absolutely nothing more important in this life or the next than having a personal relationship with God.<br> <br>But whether you&#x2019;ve just accepted Christ or have walked with Him for decades, understand that what I said to you is central and essential: Jesus is the ultimate key to knowing and living God&#x2019;s will. Jesus provides you with access to the throne of grace, so you can learn His plan for you (Heb. 4:16). He is your example of the life of faith in every way (Rom. 8:29). His Holy Spirit guides and empowers you (John 16:13-14; 1 Cor. 2:9&#x2013;16; Phil. 2:3). His prayers sustain you (Heb. 7:25). His Word provides a light to your path (Ps. 119:105).<br> <br>I say this because many people believe that God&#x2019;s will is about living by a specific religious or moral standard or making certain decisions. And at a very basic level, it is. But it is really much more than that. It is about a profound, intimate relationship with God Himself&#x2014;a relationship that results in a life that overflows with His wisdom, purpose, and power.<br> <br>Ephesians 2:10 asserts: &#x201c;We are His workmanship, created <i>in Christ Jesus</i> for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would <i>walk in them</i>&#x201d; (emphasis added). Yes, the Father has created you with a reason in mind, to fulfill an important role in His kingdom. And it is <i>in</i> Jesus, as a person who is saved by Him, and <i>through</i> Jesus, as His disciple who is in fellowship with Him, that you discover, understand, and walk in His purposes.<br> <br>Jesus Himself said it: &#x201c;I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me&#x201d; (John 14:6). We often think of this verse in terms of salvation, but it is true of the Christian life as well. Jesus wants to be <i>your</i> way, <i>your</i> truth, and <i>your</i> life. In Him and through Him are the Father&#x2019;s will for you.<br> <br>So don&#x2019;t mistakenly think, <i>God&#x2019;s not really interested in teaching me, leading me, or revealing His will</i>. Yes, He certainly is&#x2014;more than you can ever imagine (Rom. 8:32). Not only is God attentive to the great and impactful circumstances of your life, but He is also observant of details so small they escape your notice. God cares about the problems, burdens, and conflicts that concern you. And what He wants most is a personal relationship with you where you walk with Him in such close union that you are consistently aware of His presence with you. Yes, He wants that. In fact, that&#x2019;s why He has given His own Spirit to live within you and direct you.<br> <br>No, the journey of seeking and living out God&#x2019;s will may not be easy; in fact, I can testify it is sometimes very difficult. But it is always worthwhile. Because when you listen to and follow Him, you know what happens? You get His best. You will experience the greatest joy and fulfillment&#x2014;to the deepest depths of your soul&#x2014;because you will be living out the very reason you were created.<br> <br>Are you willing?

Old friends and new faces join the community conversation which ranges from Sir Cecil Waring's plans for a home for boys of naval men killed in the war to the relocation of the Priory Preparatory School; from Charles Belton's hesitant courtship and headlong marriage to the spoiled Clarissa Graham, and to Grace Grantley's betrothment to Lord Lufton, with much discussion in between of gardens, dogs, and other country matters.<p></p><p>The older generation observes the younger with affection and concern while the younger settles into its own middle age, its prospects still shadowed by the war and its aftermath. Thirkell's marshaling of story across generations show- to quote her own praise of Lady Lufton- "all her excellent qualities to the best advantage."</p></p><p>Angela Thirkell was born in London in 1890. Mrs. Thirkell did not begin writing novels until her return to Britain in 1930; then, for the rest of her life, she produced a new book almost every year until her death in 1961.Set in 1951 and first published in 1952, the characteristically witty, nostalgic 25th novel in the beloved Barsetshire series describes the lingering effects of WWII on the fictional village that Thirkell adapted from its Victorian inventor and chronicler, Anthony Trollope. Classical scholar Eric Swan, part of a conspiracy to get his friend Charles Belton married to the lovely Clarissa Graham (once beloved by young Lord Ludovic Lufton), finds himself falling for librarian Grace Grantley, who in turns falls for Lord Lufton. The dowager Lady Lufton, widowed and melancholic, finds solace in a platonic friendship with her rich tenant, while the birth of several babies to various members of the leading families brings renewed hope to those of the older generation who are unable to adjust to the suffering and social upheavals brought on by the war. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Glencoe Speech, Student Edition (NTC: SPEECH COMM MATTERS)</h2><p><p><em>Glencoe Speech</em> covers a full range of speech topics including interpersonal communication, listening, interviewing, extemporaneous speaking, preparing and presenting speeches, debate, and parliamentary procedure.

Bland, uninspired dishes may be fast, but will you make them again? And clever gimmicks sound great, but in reality they rarely make much sense. The team at America's Test Kitchen has created more than 200 easy-to-make 30 minute recipes that guarantee impressive results from a minimum of effort. With a little test kitchen know-how, we found ways to make naturally fast dishes even faster, and traditionally slow-cooked dinners a weeknight option. But one thing we never did was settle on shortcuts that shortchanged flavor. Some compromises simply aren't worth making, and a few extra minutes of cooking translate to time well spent. No matter the path taken, every recipe in this book is foolproof, full-flavored, and fast. It's time to make weeknight dinner interesting again.</p><p>This book has been tested, written, and edited by the test cooks, editors, food scientists, tasters, and cookware specialists at America&#x2019;s Test Kitchen, a 2,500-square-foot kitchen located just outside Boston.

The text motivates and illustrates the topics of calculus with examples drawn from many areas of biology, including genetics, biomechanics, medicine, pharmacology, physiology, ecology, epidemiology, and evolution, to name a few. Particular attention has been paid to ensuring that all applications of the mathematics are genuine, and references to the primary biological literature for many of these has been provided so that students and instructors can explore the applications in greater depth. Although the focus is on the interface between mathematics and the life sciences, the logical structure of the book is motivated by the mathematical material. Students will come away from a course based on this book with a sound knowledge of mathematics and an understanding of the importance of mathematical arguments. Equally important, they will also come away with a clear understanding of how these mathematical concepts and techniques are central in the life sciences.</p><p>The late James Stewart received his M.S. from Stanford University and his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto.

Unlike the Civil Rights Movement that called for full citizenship rights for blacks within the U.S., the Black Panther Party rejected the legitimacy of the U.S. government and positioned itself as part of a global struggle against American imperialism. In the face of intense repression, the Party flourished, becoming the center of a revolutionary movement with offices in 68 U.S. cities and powerful allies around the world.<br> <br> <i>Black against Empire</i> is the first comprehensive overview and analysis of the history and politics of the Black Panther Party. The authors analyze key political questions, such as why so many young black people across the country risked their lives for the revolution, why the Party grew most rapidly during the height of repression, and why allies abandoned the Party at its peak of influence. Bold, engrossing, and richly detailed, this book cuts through the mythology and obfuscation, revealing the political dynamics that drove the explosive growth of this revolutionary movement, and its disastrous unraveling. Informed by twelve years of meticulous archival research, as well as familiarity with most of the former Party leadership and many rank-and-file members, this book is the definitive history of one of the greatest challenges ever posed to American state power.</p><p>"This is the definitive history of one of the great revolutionary organizations in the history of this country.... Let us learn deep democratic lessons and strong anti-imperial conclusions from this magisterial book!"<b>--Cornel West, Princeton</b><br>"This is the book we've all been waiting for: the first complete history of the Black Panther Party, devoid of the hype, the nonsense, the one-dimensional heroes and villains, the myths, or the tunnel vision that has limited scholarly and popular treatments across the ideological spectrum. Bloom and Martin's riveting, nuanced, and highly original account revises our understanding of the party's size, scope, ideology, and political complexity, and offers the most compelling explanations for its ebbs and flows and ultimate demise. Moreover, they reveal with spectacular clarity that the Party's primary target was not just police brutality or urban poverty or white supremacy but U.S. Empire in all of its manifestations."<b>--Robin D. G. Kelley, UCLA</b><br>"Bloom and Martin bring to light an important chapter in American history. They carefully mine the archival data to give us an account of the rise of the Black Panther Party, of its successes and the shoals of American politics on which it fractured. In the process they give full credit to the strategic agency of the remarkable revolutionaries at the center of the story."&nbsp;<b>--Frances Fox Piven, President, American Sociological Association</b><br>"Joshua Bloom and Waldo E. Martin, Jr., have written the first comprehensive political history of the Black Panther Party. They present an unvarnished, judicious treatment of a much revered, much maligned, and widely misunderstood revolutionary organization leading the charge for 'Black Power' in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They provide persuasive answers to questions about the Party's rise and fall that others have failed to fully address. All other scholars will henceforth have to grapple with their substantial findings. General readers will find it compelling too."&nbsp;<b>--Tera Hunter, Princeton</b><br>"In a stunning historical account, Joshua Bloom and Waldo Martin map the complex trajectory of the ideology and practice of the Black Panther Party. Going beyond merely chronicling 'what happened,' the authors situate the rise and fall of the Panthers within the prevailing, and constantly shifting, political climate at home and abroad. Much has been written about the Party, but&nbsp;<i>Black against Empire</i>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<i>the</i>&nbsp;definitive history of the Panthers--one that helps us rethink the very meaning of a revolutionary movement."<b>--Michael Omi, Berkeley</b><br>"As important as the Black Panthers were to the evolution of black power, the African American freedom struggle, and, indeed, the sixties as a whole, scholarship on the group has been surprisingly thin and all too often polemical. Certainly no definitive scholarly account of the Panthers has been produced to date, or rather&nbsp;<i>had</i>&nbsp;been produced to date. Bloom and Martin can now lay claim to that honor. This is, by a wide margin, the most detailed, analytically sophisticated, and balanced account of the organization yet written. Anyone who hopes to understand the group and its impact on American culture and politics will need to read this book."<b>--Doug McAdam, Stanford</b><br>"This meticulously researched history explores the combination of revolutionary commitment and historical circumstance that enabled the emergence of the Black Panther Party. Because they do not shy away from the contradictions that animated this movement, Joshua Bloom and Waldo Martin pose crucial questions about the genesis, rise, and decline of the BPP that are as relevant to young generations of activists as they are to those who came of age during that era."&nbsp;<b>--Angela Y. Davis, University of California</b><br>"Remarkable.... As one who lived through the Panther era, I believe this book should become a standard historical work for years to come."&nbsp;<b>--Tom Hayden, author of&nbsp;<i>The Long Sixties: From 1960 to Barack Obama</i></b><i><br>"An essential, deeply researched, and insightful study--the best so far--of the complex history, inner workings, and conflicted legacy of the Black Panther Party as it waged its relentless battle for human rights and racial dignity in the streets of urban America."&nbsp;<b>--Leon F. Litwack, President, Organization of American Historians</b><br>"Finally! A book that clarifies the history of our movement, our aspirations, our struggles, and the bitter challenges we faced. This is a profoundly important and revealing work. Everyone who lived through these events, anyone who wants to understand the Black Panther Party, and especially the younger generations striving to shape the future, must read this book!"--<b>Bobby Seale, Chairman, Black Panther Party</b></i><b>Joshua Bloom</b>&nbsp;is&nbsp;Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Pittsburgh.

Originally from Michigan, she now lives in Seattle, Washington.<p> I felt her fear before I heard her screams. </p> <p>Her nightmare pulsed into me, shaking me out of my own dream, which had had something to do with a beach and Orlando Bloom rubbing suntan oil on me. Images&#x2013;hers, not mine&#x2013;tumbled through my mind: fire and blood, the smell of smoke, the twisted metal of a car. The pictures wrapped around me, suffocating me, until some rational part of my brain reminded me that this wasn't my dream. </p> <p>I woke up, strands of long, dark hair sticking to my forehead. </p> <p>Lissa lay in her bed, thrashing and screaming. I bolted out of mine, quickly crossing the few feet that separated us. </p> <p>"Liss," I said, shaking her. "Liss, wake up." </p> <p>Her screams dropped off, replaced by soft whimpers. "Andre," she moaned. "Oh God." </p> <p>I helped her sit up. "Liss, you aren't there anymore. Wake up." </p> <p>After a few moments, her eyes fluttered open, and in the dim lighting, I could see a flicker of consciousness start to take over. Her frantic breathing slowed, and she leaned into me, resting her head against my shoulder. I put an arm around her and ran a hand over her hair. </p> <p>"It's okay," I told her gently. "Everything's okay." </p> <p>"I had that dream." </p> <p>"Yeah. I know." </p> <p>We sat like that for several minutes, not saying anything else. When I felt her emotions calm down, I leaned over to the nightstand between our beds and turned on the lamp. It glowed dimly, but neither of us really needed much to see by. Attracted by the light, our housemate's cat Oscar leapt up into the open window. </p> <p>He gave me a wide berth&#x2013;animals don't like dhampirs, for whatever reason&#x2013;but jumped up on the bed and rubbed his head against Lissa, purring softly. Animals didn't have a problem with Moroi, and they all loved Lissa in particular. Smiling, she scratched his chin, and I felt her calm further. </p> <p>"When did we last do a feeding?" I asked, studying her face. Her fair skin was paler than usual. Dark circles hung under her eyes, and there was an air of frailty about her. School had been hectic this week, and I couldn't remember the last time I'd given her blood. "It's been like . . . over two days, hasn't it? Three? Why didn't you say anything?" </p> <p>She shrugged and wouldn't meet my eyes. "You were busy. I didn't want to&#x2013;;" </p> <p>"Screw that," I said, shifting into a better position. No wonder she seemed so weak. Oscar, not wanting me any closer, leapt down and returned to the window, where he could watch at a safe distance. "Come on. Let's do this." </p> <p>"Rose&#x2013;" </p> <p>"Come on. It'll make you feel better." </p> <p>I tilted my head and tossed my hair back, baring my neck. I saw her hesitate, but the sight of my neck and what it offered proved too powerful. A hungry expression crossed her face, and her lips parted slightly, exposing the fangs she normally kept hidden while living among humans. Those fangs contrasted oddly with the rest of her features. With her pretty face and pale blond hair, she looked more like an angel than a vampire. </p> <p>As her teeth neared my bare skin, I felt my heart race with a mix of fear and anticipation. I always hated feeling the latter, but it was nothing I could help, a weakness I couldn't shake. </p> <p>Her fangs bit into me, hard, and I cried out at the brief flare of pain. Then it faded, replaced by a wonderful, golden joy that spread through my body. It was better than any of the times I'd been drunk or high. Better than sex&#x2013;or so I imagined, since I'd never done it. It was a blanket of pure, refined pleasure, wrapping me up and promising everything would be right in the world. On and on it went. The chemicals in her saliva triggered an endorphin rush, and I lost track of the world, lost track of who I was. </p> <p>Then, regretfully, it was over. It had taken less than a minute. </p> <p>She pulled back, wiping her hand across her lips as she studied me. "You okay?" </p> <p>"I . . . yeah." I lay back on the bed, dizzy from the blood loss. "I just need to sleep it off. I'm fine." </p> <p>Her pale, jade-green eyes watched me with concern. She stood up. "I'm going to get you something to eat." </p> <p>My protests came awkwardly to my lips, and she left before I could get out a sentence. The buzz from her bite had lessened as soon as she broke the connection, but some of it still lingered in my veins, and I felt a goofy smile cross my lips. Turning my head, I glanced up at Oscar, still sitting in the window. </p> <p>"You don't know what you're missing," I told him. </p> <p>His attention was on something outside. Hunkering down into a crouch, he puffed out his jet-black fur. His tail started twitching. </p> <p>My smile faded, and I forced myself to sit up. The world spun, and I waited for it to right itself before trying to stand. When I managed it, the dizziness set in again and this time refused to leave. Still, I felt okay enough to stumble to the window and peer out with Oscar. He eyed me warily, scooted over a little, and then returned to whatever had held his attention. </p> <p>A warm breeze&#x2013;unseasonably warm for a Portland fall&#x2013;played with my hair as I leaned out. The street was dark and relatively quiet. It was three in the morning, just about the only time a college campus settled down, at least somewhat. The house in which we'd rented a room for the past eight months sat on a residential street with old, mismatched houses. Across the road, a streetlight flickered, nearly ready to burn out. It still cast enough light for me to make out the shapes of cars and buildings. In our own yard, I could see the silhouettes of trees and bushes. </p> <p>And a man watching me. </p> <p>I jerked back in surprise. A figure stood by a tree in the yard, about thirty feet away, where he could easily see through the window. He was close enough that I probably could have thrown something and hit him. He was certainly close enough that he could have seen what Lissa and I had just done. </p> <p>The shadows covered him so well that even with my heightened sight, I couldn't make out any of his features, save for his height. He was tall. Really tall. He stood there for just a moment, barely discernible, and then stepped back, disappearing into the shadows cast by the trees on the far side of the yard. I was pretty sure I saw someone else move nearby and join him before the blackness swallowed them both. </p> <p>Whoever these figures were, Oscar didn't like them. Not counting me, he usually got along with most people, growing upset only when someone posed an immediate danger. The guy outside hadn't done anything threatening to Oscar, but the cat had sensed something, something that put him on edge. </p> <p>Something similar to what he always sensed in me. </p> <p>Icy fear raced through me, almost&#x2013;but not quite&#x2013;eradicating the lovely bliss of Lissa's bite. Backing up from the window, I jerked on a pair of jeans that I found on the floor, nearly falling over in the process. Once they were on, I grabbed my coat and Lissa's, along with our wallets. Shoving my feet into the first shoes I saw, I headed out the door. </p> <p>Downstairs, I found her in the cramped kitchen, rummaging through the refrigerator. One of our housemates, Jeremy, sat at the table, hand on his forehead as he stared sadly at a calculus book. Lissa regarded me with surprise. </p> <p>"You shouldn't be up." </p> <p>"We have to go. Now." </p> <p>Her eyes widened, and then a moment later, understanding clicked in. "Are you . . . really? Are you sure?" </p> <p>I nodded. I couldn't explain how I knew for sure. I just did. </p> <p>Jeremy watched us curiously. "What's wrong?" </p> <p>An idea came to mind. "Liss, get his car keys." </p> <p>He looked back and forth between us. "What are you&#x2013;" </p> <p>Lissa unhesitatingly walked over to him. Her fear poured into me through our psychic bond, but there was something else too: her complete faith that I would take care of everything, that we would be safe. Like always, I hoped I was worthy of that kind of trust. </p> <p>She smiled broadly and gazed directly into his eyes. For a moment, Jeremy just stared, still confused, and then I saw the thrall seize him. His eyes glazed over, and he regarded her adoringly. </p> <p>"We need to borrow your car," she said in a gentle voice. "Where are your keys?" </p> <p>He smiled, and I shivered. I had a high resistance to compulsion, but I could still feel its effects when it was directed at another person. That, and I'd been taught my entire life that using it was wrong. Reaching into his pocket, Jeremy handed over a set of keys hanging on a large red key chain. </p> <p>"Thank you," said Lissa. "And where is it parked?" </p> <p>"Down the street," he said dreamily. "At the corner. By Brown." Four blocks away. </p> <p>"Thank you," she repeated, backing up. "As soon as we leave, I want you to go back to studying. Forget you ever saw us tonight." </p> <p>He nodded obligingly. I got the impression he would have walked off a cliff for her right then if she'd asked. All humans were susceptible to compulsion, but Jeremy appeared weaker than most. That came in handy right now. </p> <p>"Come on," I told her. "We've got to move." </p> <p>We stepped outside, heading toward the corner he'd named. I was still dizzy from the bite and kept stumbling, unable to move as quickly as I wanted. Lissa had to catch hold of me a few times to stop me from falling. All the time, that anxiety rushed into me from her mind. I tried my best to ignore it; I had my own fears to deal with. </p> <p>"Rose . . . what are we going to do if they catch us?" she whispered. </p> <p>"They won't," I said fiercely. "I won't let them." </p> <p>"But if they've found us&#x2013;" </p> <p>"They found us before. They didn't catch us then. We'll just drive over to the train station and go to L.A. They'll lose the trail." </p> <p>I made it sound simple. I always did, even though there was nothing simple about being on the run from the people we'd grown up with. We'd been doing it for two years, hiding wherever we could and just trying to finish high school. Our senior year had just started, and living on a college campus had seemed safe. We were so close to freedom. </p> <p>She said nothing more, and I felt her faith in me surge up once more. This was the way it had always been between us. I was the one who took action, who made sure things happened&#x2013;sometimes recklessly so. She was the more reasonable one, the one who thought things out and researched them extensively before acting. Both styles had their uses, but at the moment, recklessness was called for. We didn't have time to hesitate. </p> <p>Lissa and I had been best friends ever since kindergarten, when our teacher had paired us together for writing lessons. Forcing five-year-olds to spell Vasilisa Dragomir and Rosemarie Hathaway was beyond cruel, and we'd&#x2013;or rather, I'd&#x2013;responded appropriately. I'd chucked my book at our teacher and called her a fascist bastard. I hadn't known what those words meant, but I'd known how to hit a moving target. </p> <p>Lissa and I had been inseparable ever since. </p> <p>"Do you hear that?" she asked suddenly. </p> <p>It took me a few seconds to pick up what her sharper senses already had. Footsteps, moving fast. I grimaced. We had two more blocks to go. </p> <p>"We've got to run for it," I said, catching hold of her arm. </p> <p>"But you can't&#x2013;" </p> <p>"Run." </p> <p>It took every ounce of my willpower not to pass out on the sidewalk. My body didn't want to run after losing blood or while still metabolizing the effects of her saliva. But I ordered my muscles to stop their bitching and clung to Lissa as our feet pounded against the concrete. Normally I could have outrun her without any extra effort&#x2013;particularly since she was barefoot&#x2013;but tonight, she was all that held me upright. </p> <p>The pursuing footsteps grew louder, closer. Black stars danced before my eyes. Ahead of us, I could make out Jeremy's green Honda. Oh God, if we could just make it&#x2013; </p> <p>Ten feet from the car, a man stepped directly into our path. We came to a screeching halt, and I jerked Lissa back by her arm. It was him, the guy I'd seen across the street watching me. He was older than us, maybe mid-twenties, and as tall as I'd figured, probably six-six or six-seven. And under different circumstances&#x2013;say, when he wasn't holding up our desperate escape&#x2013;I would have thought he was hot. Shoulder-length brown hair, tied back into a short ponytail. Dark brown eyes. A long brown coat like horse riders wore, not quite a trench coat. A duster, I thought it was called. </p> <p>But his hotness was irrelevant now. He was only an obstacle keeping Lissa and me away from the car and our freedom. The footsteps behind us slowed, and I knew our pursuers had caught up. Off to the sides, I detected more movement, more people closing in. God. They'd sent almost a dozen guardians to retrieve us. I couldn't believe it. The queen herself didn't travel with that many. </p> <p>Panicked and not entirely in control of my higher reasoning, I acted out of instinct. I pressed up to Lissa, keeping her behind me and away from the man who appeared to be the leader. </p> <p>"Leave her alone," I growled. "Don't touch her." </p> <p>His face was unreadable, but he held out his hands in what was apparently supposed to be some sort of calming gesture, like I was a rabid animal he was planning to sedate. </p> <p>"I'm not going to&#x2013;" </p> <p>He took a step forward. Too close. </p> <p>I attacked him, leaping out in an offensive maneuver I hadn't used in two years, not since Lissa and I had run away. The move was stupid, another reaction born of instinct and fear. And it was hopeless. He was a skilled guardian, not a novice who hadn't finished his training. He also wasn't weak and on the verge of passing out. And man, was he fast. I'd forgotten how fast guardians could be, how they could move and strike like cobras. He knocked me off as though brushing away a fly, and his hands slammed into me and sent me backwards. I don't think he meant to strike that hard&#x2013;probably just intended to keep me away&#x2013;but my lack of coordination interfered with my ability to respond. Unable to catch my footing, I started to fall, heading straight toward the sidewalk at a twisted angle, hip-first. It was going to hurt. A t </p> <p>Only it didn't. </p> <p>Just as quickly as he'd blocked me, the man reached out and caught my arm, keeping me upright. When I'd steadied myself, I noticed he was staring at me&#x2013;or, more precisely, at my neck. Still disoriented, I didn't get it right away. Then, slowly, my free hand reached up to the side of my throat and lightly touched the wound Lissa had made earlier. </p> <p>When I pulled my fingers back, I saw slick, dark blood on my skin. Embarrassed, I shook my hair so that it fell forward around my face. It was thick and long and completely covered my neck. I'd grown it out for precisely this reason. </p> <p>The guy's dark eyes lingered on the now-covered bite a moment longer and then met mine. I returned his look defiantly and quickly jerked out of his hold. He let me go, though I knew he could have restrained me all night if he'd wanted. Fighting the nauseating dizziness, I backed toward Lissa again, bracing myself for another attack. Suddenly, her hand caught hold of mine. "Rose," she said quietly. "Don't." </p> <p>Her words had no effect on me at first, but calming thoughts gradually began to settle in my mind, coming across through the bond. It wasn't exactly compulsion&#x2013;she wouldn't use that on me&#x2013;but it was effectual, as was the fact that we were hopelessly outnumbered and outclassed. Even I knew this would be pointless. The tension left my body, and I sagged in defeat. </p> <p>Sensing my resignation, the man stepped forward, turning his attention to Lissa. His face was calm. He swept her a bow and managed to look graceful doing it, which surprised me considering his height.

The novel many consider to be the most important literary work of the twentieth century was, at the time, deemed obscene and scandalous, resulting in the eventual seizure of <i>The Little Review</i> and the placing of a legal ban on Joyce&#x2019;s masterwork that would not be lifted in the United States until 1933. For the first time, <i>The Little Review &#x201c;Ulysses&#x201d;</i> brings together the serial installments of <i>Ulysses</i> to create a new edition of the novel, enabling teachers, students, scholars, and general readers to see how one of the previous century&#x2019;s most daring and influential prose narratives evolved, and how it was initially introduced to an audience who recognized its radical potential to transform Western literature.

The structure of the contemporary University is changing rapidly, and we have yet to understand what precisely these changes will mean. Is a new age dawning for the University, the renaissance of higher education under way? Or is the University in the twilight of its social function, the demise of higher education fast approaching?We can answer such questions only if we look carefully at the different roles the University has played historically and then imagine how it might be possible to live, and to think, amid the ruins of the University. Tracing the roots of the modern American University in German philosophy and in the work of British thinkers such as Newman and Arnold, Bill Readings argues that historically the integrity of the modern University has been linked to the nation-state, which it has served by promoting and protecting the idea of a national culture. But now the nation-state is in decline, and national culture no longer needs to be either promoted or protected. Increasingly, universities are turning into transnational corporations, and the idea of culture is being replaced by the discourse of "excellence." On the surface, this does not seem particularly pernicious.</p><p>The author cautions, however, that we should not embrace this techno-bureaucratic appeal too quickly. The new University of Excellence is a corporation driven by market forces, and, as such, is more interested in profit margins than in thought. Readings urges us to imagine how to think, without concession to corporate excellence or recourse to romantic nostalgia within an institution in ruins. The result is a passionate appeal for a new community of thinkers.</p></p><p>Bill Readings was Associate Professor of Comparative Literature at the Universit� de Montr�al.&#x201c;Readings argues compellingly that the university has outlived its purpose--a purpose defined two centuries ago, when the nation-state and the modern notion of culture came together to make the university the guardian of national culture...What, Readings asks, "is the point of the University, if we realize that we are no longer to strive to realize a national identity, be it an ethnic essence or a republican will?" What happens when the culture the university was meant to preserve goes global and transnational along with everything else? This is an intriguing argument. And...it helps to explain much. From this perspective, for example, Readings is wonderfully insightful on the "culture wars" that have wracked universities and bewildered the public for two decades...Readings offers a call to arms to those of us who live and work in universities as well as to those on the outside--a call to better understand our position in a changing world, to come out of our professional shells, stop pining for a lost world, and actively seek to construct something different...[This is] a remarkable contribution.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Harvey</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Atlantic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The University is a ruined institution, forced to abandon its historical <i>raison d'etre</i> and enmeshed in consumerist ideology...The task that substitutes for the pursuit of culture is the adherence to Excellence, which relegates the university to the treadmill of global capitalism. It turns out graduates as objects, not subjects, at so much per head, under the scrutiny of the state bureaucracy. That is the nub of Bill Readings's superbly argued pessimism...His essay provides an insight into contemporary vexation as experienced in every form of society and community obliged to exist in the new globalized economy. The university has always suggested an institution immune to wider trends, but Readings...argues very convincingly for its fragility. It is a microcosm caught in the coils of consumerism, and forced to act as a satrap in that kingdom...The dysfunction, as he envisages it, is very deeply pondered and rather brilliantly expounded.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony Smith, President, Magdalen College, Oxford</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Statesman and Society</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Bill Readings...presents a comprehensible and intelligent interpretation of the status and meaning of the university today which draws inspiration for its ideas from paradigms as diverse as Jean-Paul Lyotard's seminal <i>The Postmodern Condition</i> and the cult movie of the late 1980s, <i>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</i>...Anyone who has been through the academic mill in the English-speaking world at any level in the last decade will certainly have no problem perceiving the truth of Readings's observation that corporate-style management has become part of the fabric of university administration.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Natasha Lehrer</b><b>, </b><b><i>Jerusalem Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] fiercely intelligent polemic about the contemporary university...Whether they're polishing off the latest bit of research or merely fishing in some desolate sound during the summer break, <i>The University in Ruins</i> is a book that's indispensable to everyone working in or attending post-secondary institutions. If they're not in ruins yet, they're certainly under siege.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stan Persky</b><b>, </b><b><i>Toronto Globe and Mail</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] acerbic, often witty critique of the University...[Readings] would have made a formidable opponent in the debates that his book will surely occasion...[W]e should be thankful [for Readings' book] because it raises precisely the large theoretical questions that university types often prefer to ignore.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sanford Pinsker</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Georgia Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Bill Readings' scholarly work <i>The University in Ruins</i> is one of the most challenging and critical books of this genre. He argues compellingly that there is a crisis of purpose in the modern university...Readings' arguments about the linkages between globalisation, corporatism, culture and the university provide an important insight into the malaise of the contemporary university...This highly intelligent and fiercely written book is a fine epitaph to a scholar of rare distinction.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mal Logan</b><b>, </b><b><i>Quadrant</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The University in Ruins</i> is both challenging and accessible. Readings can discuss the German Idealists and Macro-Economists, F. R. Leavis and Francois Lyotard, Beavis and Butt-Head, even Bill and Ted and (of course) their Excellent Adventure-all without obfuscation or condescension. His book offers acute assessments of higher education, its architects, and its critics. There is much material for reflection and debate here; that's the way Bill liked things and what he liked best about the university.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stephen M. Buhler</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of English and Germanic Philology</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Sadly, Readings died in a plane crash shortly after this acerbic, often witty critique of the University was completed. He would have made a formidable opponent in the debates that his book will surely occasion But what we have is Readings' book, and for that we should be thankful because it raises precisely the large theoretical questions that university types often prefer to ignore.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sanford Pinsker</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Georgia Review</i></b></p><h2>Krasner&#39;s Microbial Challenge: A Public Health Perspective: A Public Health Perspective</h2><p>Krasner's Microbial Challenge: A Public Health Perspective is a unique resource unlike any other introductory microbiology textbook.

Not only was the writing extraordinary but its sudden and spectacular appearance itself seemed magical. In fact, Latin American literature has a long and rich tradition that reaches back to the Colonial period and is filled with remarkable writers too little known in the English-speaking world. The short story has been a central part of this tradition, from Fray Bartolome de las Casas' narrative protests against the Spanish Conquistadors' abuses of Indians, to the world renowned <em>Ficciones</em> of Jorge Luis Borges, to the contemporary works of such masters as Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Rosario Ferre, and others. <br><br>Now, in <em>The Oxford Book of Latin American Short Stories</em>, editor Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria brings together fifty-three stories that span the history of Latin American literature and represent the most dazzling achievements in the form. In his fascinating introduction, Gonzalez Echevarria traces the evolution of the short story in Latin American literature, explaining why the genre has flourished there with such brilliance, and illuminating the various cultural and literary tensions that resolve themselves in "magical realism." The stories themselves exhibit all the inventiveness, the luxuriousness of language, the wild metaphoric leaps and uncanny conjunctions of the ordinary with the fantastic that have given the Latin American short story its distinctive and unforgettable flavor: From the Joycean subtlety of Machado de Assis's "Midnight Mass," to the brutal parable of Julio Ramon Ribeyro's "Featherless Buzzards," to the startling disorientation of Alejo Carpentier's "Journey Back to the Source," (which is told backwards, because a sorcerer has waved his wand and made time flow in reverse), to the haunting reveries of Maria Luisa Bombal's "The Tree." Readers familiar with only the most popular Latin American writers will be delighted to discover many exciting new voices here, including Catalina de Erauso, Ricardo Palma, Rubin Dario, Augusto Roa Bastos, Christina Peri Rossi, along with Borges, Garcia Marquez, Fuentes, Cortazar, Vargas Llosa, and many others. Gonzalez Echevarria also provides brief and extremely helpful headnotes for the each selection, discussing the author's influences, major works, and central themes.<br><br>Short story lovers will find a wealth of satisfactions here, in terrains both familiar and uncharted. But the unique strength of <em>The Oxford Book of Latin American Short Stories</em> is that it allows us to see the connections between writers from Peru to Puerto Rico and from the sixteenth century to the present--and thus to view in a single, unprecedented volume one of the most diverse and fertile literary landscapes in the world.<br></p><p><br>Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria is Sterling Professor of Hispanic and Comparative Literatures, Yale University.

Then it came back, along with Ceres and Eris...and now Haumea and MakeMake, too! The recent actions of the International Astronomical Union have put every solar system book out of date. In response, National Geographic joins forces with David Aguilar of the Harvard Smithsonian Astronomical Observatory to revise our 2008 book&#x2014;and to update young readers on the high-interest topic of space. Using simple text and spectacular photorealistic computer art by the author, this book profiles all 13 planets in their newly created categories&#x2014;plus the sun, the Oort Cloud, comets, and other worlds being discovered. Back-of-the-book activities offer hands-on fun for budding astronomers.</p><p><b>David A. Aguilar</b>&nbsp;is the author and illustrator of several books from National Geographic. His <i>13 Planets: The Latest View of the Solar System</i> received the Eureka! Nonfiction Children's Book Gold Award from the California Reading Association. His writings are widely recognized for their ability to communicate the wonderment of science to enthusiasts of all ages. He is the originator of the Science Discovery program at the University of Colorado, Boulder; the popular host of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics Observatory Nights program; and the past director of the Fiske Planetarium.Once upon a time, long ago and far away, there were precisely seven planets: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, all apparently revolving around a solidly fixed Earth. And then about five centuries ago came Nicholas Copernicus, who invented the solar system. He said the Sun was really in the middle surrounded by six planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth (with Moon), Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. It was truly the Sun&#x2019;s system, with Earth now a spinning planet. It was all very simple and elegant.<br> &nbsp;<br> Three centuries after Copernicus, things were no longer so simple. In 1781 another big planet, Uranus, was found, and then a lot of small ones were given names like Ceres, Astraea, Flora, Hygeia, and Kalliope. In 1846, still another big planet, Neptune, gained planetary status. By 1854 there were 41 planets, and astronomers cried &#x201c;Enough!&#x201d; So they all decided there were eight large planets, and the little guys weren&#x2019;t really planets but minor planets.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today astronomers know that the solar system is much more complex and interesting than anyone dreamed of in the 1850s. There are more than 130 natural satellites, and more are being discovered. One, Saturn&#x2019;s Titan, is bigger than the planet Mercury. If Titan and our moon had independent orbits, they would qualify as planets. Astronomers now have orbits for nearly 500,000 minor planets, half of which have been assigned numbers, and about 15,000 of which have been given names. Almost all of them are irregularly-shaped rocks, but at least one, Ceres, is massive enough for its gravity to pull it into a sphere, so it is a dwarf planet. And there are the comets, hoards of them in the deep freeze beyond Neptune. <br> &nbsp;<br> Occasionally some of these huge chunks of dirty ice get nudged into the inner parts of the solar system, where they thaw out and sprout long, beautiful tails. And a few of these ice balls are massive enough to pull themselves into spherical dwarf planets. Pluto is one of these, smaller than our moon. Makemake and Haumea are still smaller, while Eris is a little larger than Pluto. Three of these even have their own satellites. Undoubtedly more of these icy dwarf planets await discovery.<br> &nbsp;<br> For now, there are eight classical planets and five dwarf planets, making thirteen!<br> &nbsp;<br> --Dr. Owen Gingerich, Former Research Professor of Astronomy, Harvard and Astronomer Emeritus, Smithsonian Astronomical Observatory</p><h2>Becoming Native to This Place</h2><p>In six compelling essays, Wes Jackson lays the foundation for a new farming economy grounded in nature&#x2019;s principles. Exploding the tenets of industrial agriculture, Jackson, a respected advocate for sustainable practices and the founder of The Land Institute, seeks to integrate food production with nature in a way that sustains both.</p><p>Ideas seem to advance in waves upon the modern mind, and one of the concepts cresting at present is the notion of place. This recent swell could be charted back to Daniel Kemmis's 1992 book <i>Community and the Politics of Place</i> as well as his more recent meditation on the inhabitation of cities (<i>The Good City and the Good Life</i>). Wendell Berry's <i>A Place on Earth</i> continued the theme, as has Alan Thein Durning's recent book <i>This Place on Earth</i>. Wes Jackson, a bioligist by training, applies the notion of place to a rethinking of ecological and agricultural policy. His hope is that the concept of place will seep deeply into our thoughts and affect the very way we inhabit the world. In effect, Jackson argues for inverting the slogan "think globally, act locally": when we think of the whole Earth on a local level as a group of loved places rather than territory or resource pools, then we will be headed in the right direction.In a ringing cry for a changed relation to the land, Jackson urges modern Americans to become truly native to this place--to base our culture and agriculture on nature&#39;s principles, to recycle as natural ecosystems have for millions of years.</p><h2>Spectrum Language Arts Grade 6, Ages 11 to 12, Grade 6 Language Arts, Vocabulary, Sentence Types, Parts of Speech, Writing Practice, and Grammar Workbook - 184 Pages</h2><p><p>GRADE 6/AGES 11&#x2013;12: The Spectrum Language Arts for 6th Grade Workbook helps your child speak, read, and write with confidence and clarity.

It is the story of an adolescent who must learn to live with the painful fact that he is unlike other young men. Mishima&#39;s protagonist discovers that he is becoming a homosexual in a polite, post-war Japan. To survive, he must live behind a mask of propriety.Yukio Mishima (1925-1970) was many people. The best known in Japan of the writers to emerge there after World War II, he was by far the most published abroad. Mishima completed his first novel the year he entered the University of Tokyo. More followed (some twenty-three, the last completed the day of his death in November, 1970), along with more than forty play, over ninety short stories, several poetry and travel volumes and hundreds of essays. Influenced by European literature, in which he was exceptionally well read, he was an interpreter to his own people of Japan's ancient virtues, to which he urged a return. He had sung on the stage, starred in and directed movies and was a noted practitioner of Japan's traditional martial arts. He seemed at the height of his career and vitality at the age of forty-five, when after a demonstration in the public interest he committed suicide by ceremonial seppuku.<br><br>Meredith Weatherby was an American publisher of Japanese texts.</p><h2>The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze (New Directions Classic)</h2><p><p><strong>Saroyan&#x2019;s debut collection of stories.</strong></p> A timeless selection of brilliant short stories that won William Saroyan a position among the foremost, most widely popular writers of America when it first appeared in 1934.With the greatest of ease William Saroyan flew across the literary skies in 1934 with the publication of <i>The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze and Other Stories</i>. One of the first American writers to describe the immigrant experience in the U.S., Saroyan created characters who were Armenians, Jews, Chinese, Poles, Africans, and the Irish. The title story touchingly portrays the thoughts of a very young writer, dying of starvation. All of the tales were written during the great depression and reflect, through pathos and humor, the mood of the nation in one of its greatest times of want.</p><p>William Saroyan (1908&#x2013;1981) was born in Fresno, California. Famous for a long and voluminous career, he wrote novels, along with some sixteen story collections, and plays including&nbsp;The Human Comedy&nbsp;(winning an Academy Award for his screenplay), and&nbsp;The Time of Your Life, for which he won the Drama Critics Circle and Pulitzer Prizes. He wrote about "the archetypal Armenian families who inhabit Saroyan country, in and around Fresno, California. [And yet with their] unpredictable charm and wacky spontaneity ... his characters overflow with so much human comedy that they transcend all ethnic boundaries, as in the stories of I.B. Singer" (The Chicago Tribune).</p><h2>On Being Ill: with Notes from Sick Rooms by Julia Stephen (Paris Press)</h2><p>This new publication of On Being Ill with Notes from Sick Rooms presents Virginia Woolf and her mother Julia Stephen in textual conversation for the first time in literary history. In the poignant and humorous essay On Being Ill, Virginia Woolf observes that though illness is a part of every human being's experience, it is not celebrated as a subject of great literature in the way that love and war are embraced by writers and readers. We must, Woolf says, invent a new language to describe pain. Illness, she observes, enhances our perceptions and reduces self-consciousness; it is "the great confessional." Woolf discusses the taboos associated with illness and she explores how it changes our relationship to the world around us. Notes from Sick Rooms addresses illness from the caregiver's perspective. With clarity, humor, and pathos, Julia Stephen offers concrete and useful information to caregivers today.<br><br>Originally published by Paris Press in 2002 as On Being Ill, this paperback edition includes an introduction to Notes from Sick Rooms and to Julia Stephen by Mark Hussey, the founding editor of Woolf Studies Annual, and a poignant afterword by Rita Charon, MD, the founder of the field of Narrative Medicine. Hermione Lee's brilliant introduction to On Being Ill is a superb introduction to Virginia Woolf's life and writing. This book is embraced by the general public, the literary world, and the medical world.</p><p>Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) is one of the great literary geniuses of the twentieth century. Her innovative fiction and essays are revered by readers around the globe. She was a central member of the Bloomsbury group and a ground-breaking feminist, publishing book-length essays that continue to change the lives of women today. Her novels include&nbsp;To the Lighthouse, Mrs. Dalloway, The Waves,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Orlando: A Biography.&nbsp;When she was not writing, Virginia Woolf operated Hogarth Press with her husband Leonard Woolf.&nbsp;She typeset the original Hogarth Press publication of On Being Ill. Throughout much of her life, Woolf faced the challenges of illness, yet she continued to create revolutionary works of literature. Julia Stephen (1846-1895), Virginia Woolf's mother, grew up in England among the painters and poets, novelists and philosophers who frequented the homes of her uncle Henry Thoby Prinsep and her aunt Julia Margaret Cameron, the acclaimed photographer. Her first husband, Herbert Duckworth, died in 1870. She married Woolf's father, Leslie Stephen, in 1878. Julia Stephen worked as a vocational nurse throughout her adult life, and published&nbsp;Notes from Sick Rooms&nbsp;in 1883."By turns lyrical, self-mocking, and outlandish, Woolf's meditation on the perils and privileges of the sickbed lampoons the loneliness that makes one glad of a kick from a housemaid and extolls the merits of bad literature for the unwell.... When Woolf imagines beauty in a frozen-over garden, even after the death of the sun... it seems less a triumph of nature than of art."&#x2015;<i>The New Yorker</i><p>"In 2002, Paris Press, the Ashfield, Mass.,nonprofit publisher, rescued a little-known work by Virginia Woolf, On Being Ill. To mark the first decade in print of the Paris Press edition, the press is reissuing On Being Ill in November in paperback for the first time in an expanded edition (to be reviewed in PW's Oct. 15 issue). But the new paperback goes beyond reproducing the 2002 edition. It includes another long out-of-print essay, Notes from Sick Rooms by Woolf's mother, Julia Stephen, which was originally published in 1883 by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. (Charlotte Bront�'s publisher). For Paris Press director Jan Freeman, the addition of the new material&#x2015;which also includes an introduction to Notes from Sick Rooms by Woolf scholar Mark Hussey and an afterword by physician Rita Charon&#x2015;has transformed the book into a 'conversation in text' between Woolf and her mother (who died when Woolf was 13), patient and nurse. 'There are wonderful parallels between the two texts,' said Freeman. 'You learn about Woolf by reading Notes from Sick Rooms, and you learn about Woolf's mother's life. There's a familiarity in [Woolf's mother's] voice. Woolf didn't become a writer exclusively from the influence of her father.'"&#x2015;Publishers Weekly</p><p>"The distance that yawns between the sick and the healthy&#x2015;the 'army of the upright'&#x2015;is the terrain mapped by Virginia Woolf in a marvelously elegant essay, On Being Ill.... On Being Ill speaks to the inseparable nature of psyche and soma, the tormented mind and body as one."&#x2015;Los Angeles Times</p><p>"By turns lyrical, self-mocking, and outlandish, Woolf's meditation on the perils and privileges of the sickbed lampoons the loneliness that makes one glad of a kick from a housemaid and extolls the merits of bad literature for the unwell.... When Woolf imagines beauty in a frozen-over garden, even after the death of the sun... it seems less a triumph of nature than of art."&#x2015;The New Yorker</p><p>"Perusing this delicate yet powerful little book, we can't help but admire the shapeliness, the eloquence, the stylishness, and the incisiveness of the essay it contains. Nor can we fail to notice the witty paradoxes that animate and lend additional sparkle to this bright display of originality and intelligence.... Only in the final paragraphs of On Being Ill is the reader at last able to see what Woolf has been working toward: an affecting, resonant recapitulation and illustration of the inadequacy and superfluity of language in our efforts to describe human suffering. Which is, perhaps needless to say, also the most paradoxical aspect of the essay&#x2015;the verbal pyrotechnics, the scintillating clarity and richness of the phrases and sentences in which Woolf tells us about the poverty and limitations of language."&#x2015;Francine Prose, <i>Bookforum</i></p></p><h2>Pterosaurs: Natural History, Evolution, Anatomy</h2><p><p>For 150 million years, the skies didn't belong to birds--they belonged to the pterosaurs. These flying reptiles, which include the pterodactyls, shared the world with the nonavian dinosaurs until their extinction 65 million years ago. Some pterosaurs, such as the giant azhdarchids, were the largest flying animals of all time, with wingspans exceeding thirty feet and standing heights comparable to modern giraffes.

Here you can explore the fossil evidence of pterosaur behavior and ecology, learn about the skeletal and soft-tissue anatomy of pterosaurs, and consider the newest theories about their cryptic origins.

They pull the regulatory and financial levers of our economic well-being, yet unlike democratically elected leaders, their power does not come directly from the people. <i>Unelected Power</i> lays out the principles needed to ensure that central bankers, technocrats, regulators, and other agents of the administrative state remain stewards of the common good and do not become overmighty citizens.</p><p>Paul Tucker draws on a wealth of personal experience from his many years in domestic and international policymaking to tackle the big issues raised by unelected power, and enriches his discussion with examples from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and the European Union. Blending economics, political theory, and public law, Tucker explores the necessary conditions for delegated but politically insulated power to be legitimate in the eyes of constitutional democracy and the rule of law. He explains why the solution must fit with how real-world government is structured, and why technocrats and their political overseers need incentives to make the system work as intended. Tucker explains how the regulatory state need not be a fourth branch of government free to steer by its own lights, and how central bankers can emulate the best of judicial self-restraint and become models of dispersed power.</p><p>Like it or not, unelected power has become a hallmark of modern government. This critically important book shows how to harness it to the people's purposes.</p></p><p><p>"Paul Tucker brings years of experience at the Bank of England and deep political-economic insights to the most contentious problem of governance today: the delegation of power to independent agencies of government. He shows that the Fed and other central banks have become powerful multipurpose institutions, escaping checks and balances, risking all independence. He then unpacks an entirely novel solution--his Principles for Delegation--which will set off a needed debate over reform for many years ahead."<b>--John B. Taylor, Stanford University</b></p><p>"This book is a much-needed study of a much-neglected problem. Combining experience with theoretical expertise, Paul Tucker offers us an insightful and original account of how central banks and other unelected authorities need to be oriented and constrained within a democracy. <i>Unelected Power</i> is a significant contribution to both political theory and social science."<b>--Philip Pettit, Princeton University and Australian National University</b></p><p>"How do we reconcile delegated authority with democratic legitimacy in an era when decisions are made increasingly by experts? In this magisterial and magnificent book, Paul Tucker, drawing on his extensive experience in central banking, provides us with clear principles for determining the trade-off between professional competence and popular support. A must-read for anyone interested in the theory and practice of governance."<b>--Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England</b></p><p>"An important book on a fundamental problem--by an author who combines theoretical intelligence and practical experience in a compelling fashion."<b>--Bruce Ackerman, Yale University</b></p><p>"Paul Tucker has written a most timely and thoughtful analysis of the role of independent agencies in democratic societies. He makes clear that in practice these agencies differ widely in their practical and justifiable insulation from political pressures. Not surprisingly, he concludes by defending a high degree of independence for central banks but also emphasizing the need for caution in extending their mandate beyond the bounds of monetary policy."<b>--Paul A.

Hopkins could take the political risks his boss could not, and proved crucial to maintaining personal relations among the Big Three.

In <i>The Fall of the Ottomans</i>, award-winning historian Eugene Rogan brings the First World War and its immediate aftermath in the Middle East to vivid life, uncovering the often ignored story of the region's crucial role in the conflict. Unlike the static killing fields of the Western Front, the war in the Middle East was fast-moving and unpredictable, with the Turks inflicting decisive defeats on the Entente in Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, and Gaza before the tide of battle turned in the Allies' favor. The postwar settlement led to the partition of Ottoman lands, laying the groundwork for the ongoing conflicts that continue to plague the modern Arab world.

Along the way, he addresses such issues as:<br><ul><li>Breaking up</li><li>Getting out of the emergency lane</li><li>Being OK with your bad hair day</li><li>Dropping the drama</li></ul></p><p>Richard Carlson has written numerous books encouraging folks not to "sweat the small stuff", and his title for teens is as warm, wise, and witty as his previous works. His tone is one of an older family friend who manages to advise while still maintaining the minimum level of coolness that teens require from those who intend to guide them into adulthood. <p> With 100 different chapters, each just a few pages in length, this little book works especially well as a bedside companion or tucked in a backpack for the morning commute to school. Each chapter is devoted to a single, simple idea such as "trust your inner signals" and "root for the underdog," and plenty of real-life examples from teens are used to illustrate principles. In the second chapter, a teen volunteering at an animal shelter is used to show how just one person can make a difference, as she takes the time for one more phone call that results in saving a dog's life. The concepts are appropriate for both early high school students and new graduates--who doesn't need an occasional reminder to "be ok with your bad hair day"? Incorporating sports, theater, literature, video games, teachers, and parents into stories make these examples accessible to kids of all interests, and a sprinkling of tales from the author's own teenage years adds an effective personal note. With plenty of suggestions for adding activities into a teen's life--volunteer opportunities in particular--your child may even feel encouraged to seek out new forms of positive expression simply for the joy of the activity, rather than the old standbys of "my friends are doing it" or "I need it to get into college." <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><strong>Richard Carlson, Ph.D.</strong>, was the author of the bestselling <em>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff</em> series.

In this powerful and ground-breaking edition, Bate offers a complete and radical reappraisal of Shakespeare&#39;s bloodiest tragedy, seeing it as one of the dramatist&#39;s most inventive plays, a complex and self-conscious improvisation upon classical sources. Bate&#39;s introduction does full justice to the play&#39;s artfulness and sophistication, puts forward new arguments regarding the play&#39;s date, sources and early stage history, and devotes extended discussion to great modern productions such as those of Peter Brook and Deborah Warner.In an age in which dramatic representation of violence has become an issue of enormous controversy, Titus Andronicus is the essential play; Bate&#39;s seminal edition indicates just how far, with this early work, the young Shakespeare has already travelled towards the masterpiece of his maturity, King Lear.&#39;a great edition of a great play&#39;Julie Taymor, Director TITUS, 20th Century Fox, 1999&#34;Bate makes a really positive virtue of his treatment of the play in performance...putting a vigorous account of Titus on stage at very stage-centre in his Introduction.

These follies often included hermitages, many of which still survive, often in a ruined state. <br><br>Landowners peopled their hermitages either with imaginary hermits or with real hermits - in some cases the landowner even became his own hermit. Those who took employment as garden hermits were typically required to refrain from cutting their hair or washing, and some were dressed as druids. Unlike the hermits of the Middle Ages, these were wholly secular hermits, products of the eighteenth century fondness for 'pleasing melancholy'. <br><br>Although the fashion for them had fizzled out by the end of the eighteenth century, they had left their indelible mark on both the literature as well as the gardens of the period. And, as Gordon Campbell shows, they live on in the art, literature, and drama of our own day - as well as in the figure of the modern-day garden gnome. <br><br>This engaging and generously illustrated book takes the reader on a journey that is at once illuminating and whimsical, both through the history of the ornamental hermit and also around the sites of many of the surviving hermitages themselves, which remain scattered throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland. And for the real enthusiast, there is even a comprehensive checklist, enabling avid hermitage-hunters to locate their prey.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gordon Campbell </strong>is Professor of Renaissance Studies at the University of Leicester.

In general terms, microeconomic concepts and models can be seen to appear regularly in the work of political scientists, sociologists and psychologists. As a consequence, these and related concepts and models have now had sufficient time to influence strongly and to extend the range of policy options available to government departments. The central focus of this book is the &#39;cross-over&#39; from economic modelling to policy implementation, which remains obscure and uncertain. The author outlines the importance of a wider knowledge of microeconomics for improving the effects and orientation of public policy. He also provides a critique of some basic economic assumptions, notably the &#39;consumer sovereignty principle&#39;. Within this context the reader is in a better position to understand the &#39;marvellous insights and troubling blindnesses&#39; of economists where often what is controversial politically is not so controversial among economists.</p><p>This book explains and assesses the ways in which micro, welfare and benefit-cost economists view the world of public policy.

The solution is to rein in the market, right? <i>Radical Markets</i> turns this thinking&#x2015;and pretty much all conventional thinking about markets, both for and against&#x2015;on its head. The book reveals bold new ways to organize markets for the good of everyone. It shows how the emancipatory force of genuinely open, free, and competitive markets can reawaken the dormant nineteenth-century spirit of liberal reform and lead to greater equality, prosperity, and cooperation.</p><p>Eric Posner and Glen Weyl demonstrate why private property is inherently monopolistic, and how we would all be better off if private ownership were converted into a public auction for public benefit. They show how the principle of one person, one vote inhibits democracy, suggesting instead an ingenious way for voters to effectively influence the issues that matter most to them. They argue that every citizen of a host country should benefit from immigration&#x2015;not just migrants and their capitalist employers. They propose leveraging antitrust laws to liberate markets from the grip of institutional investors and creating a data labor movement to force digital monopolies to compensate people for their electronic data.</p><p>Only by radically expanding the scope of markets can we reduce inequality, restore robust economic growth, and resolve political conflicts. But to do that, we must replace our most sacred institutions with truly free and open competition&#x2015;<i>Radical Markets</i> shows how.</p></p><p><p> "I have always been motivated to find ways to unite the power of technology and markets with the goal of creating a more egalitarian society, and the authors of this book offer an exploration of these apparently contradictory strands."<b>--Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft</b></p><p> "Perhaps the most ambitious attempt to rethink democracy and markets since Milton Friedman.

The Great War is raging through Europe, and in the ancient, mountainous lands southwest of the Caspian Sea the Turks have begun systematically to exterminate their Christian subjects. Unable to deny his birthright or his people, one man, Gabriel Bagradian� born an Armenian, educated in Paris, married to a Frenchwoman, and an officer doing his duty as a Turkish subject in the Ottoman army� will strive to resist death at the hands of his blood enemy by leading 5,000 Armenian villagers to the top of Musa Dagh, � the mountain of Moses.� There, for forty days, in the face of almost certain death, they will suffer the siege of a Turkish army hell-bent on genocide.

Although pivotal events may be chosen to demarcate phases of historical or literary activity, the divisions tend to obscure the actual gradations and overlapping that occur. The decade of the 1920&#39;s--particularly in the United States--came closer to having a sharply defined uniqueness than most recognized periods. World War I inflicted a mortal blow upon the comfortable old world of European culture. The stock market crash in October, 1929, extinguished forever the bright lights and levity of the twenties. In the grim darkness of the Great Depression that followed, nothing survived of the madcap period except memories that took on an almost legendary aura.</p><p></p><h2>Helmut Newton: Celebrating 20 Years of Sumo</h2><p><p>Helmut Newton (1920&#x2013;2004) always showed a healthy disdain for the easy or predictable, so it&#x2019;s no surprise that the SUMO was an irresistible project. The idea of a book the size of a private exhibition, with spectacular images reproduced to state-of-the-art origination and printing standards, emerged from an open, experimental dialogue between photographer and publisher. With the SUMO weighing in&#x2015;boxed and shrink-wrapped&#x2015;at 35.4 kg (just under 80 pounds), Newton created a landmark book that stood head and shoulders above anything previously attempted, both in terms of conceptual extravagance and technical specifications.</p><p>Published in an edition of 10,000 signed and numbered copies, the SUMO sold out soon after publication and quickly multiplied its value. It now features in numerous collections around the world, including New York&#x2019;s Museum of Modern Art. The legendary copy number one, signed by more than 100 of the book&#x2019;s featured celebrities, broke the record for the most expensive book published in the 20th century, sold at an auction in Berlin on April 6, 2000 for 620,000 German marks&#x2015;about 317,000 euros.</p><p>Now, this XL edition celebrates 20 years of SUMO, the result of a project conceived by Helmut Newton some years ago.

Their conversation develops into a wide-ranging discussion on such subjects as the pursuit of beauty, the immortality of the soul and the attainment of truth, and ends with an in-depth consideration of the principles of rhetoric. Probably a work of Plato&#39;s maturity, the Phaedrus represents a high point in his achievement as a writer. This volume also contains two of his letters, which discuss his involvement in politics, in particular his role as adviser to Dionysius II of Syracuse, and are crucial documents for our understanding of Plato&#39;s life and career.</p><p>Plato (c.427-347 BC) stands with Socrates and Aristotle as one of the shapers of the whole intellectual tradition of the West. He came from a family that had long played a prominent part in Athenian political life, and it would have been natural for him to follow the same course. He declined to do so however, disgusted at the corruption of political life, and sickened especially by the execution in 339 of his friend and teacher, Socrates. Plato sought a cure for the ills of society in philosophy rather than politics, and founded the Academy in Athens. Plato wrote over twenty philosophical dialogues and his literary activity extended over half a century.Text: English, Greek (translation)</p><h2>The Essentials of Theory U: Core Principles and Applications</h2><p><b>A powerful pocket guide for practitioners that distills all of the research and materials found in Otto Scharmer's seminal texts <i>Theory U</i> and <i>Leading from the Emerging Future</i>.</b><br><br><b>Creating a Better Future</b><br><br>This book offers a concise, accessible guide to the key concepts and applications in Otto Scharmer's classic Theory U. Scharmer argues that our capacity to pay attention coshapes the world. What prevents us from attending to situations more effectively is that we aren't fully aware of that interior condition from which our attention and actions originate. Scharmer calls this lack of awareness our blind spot. He illuminates the blind spot in leadership today and offers hands-on methods to help change makers overcome it through the process, principles, and practices of Theory U. And he outlines a framework for updating the "operating systems" of our educational institutions, our economies, and our democracies. This book enables leaders and organizations in all industries and sectors to shift awareness, connect with the highest future possibilities, and strengthen the capacity to co-shape the future.</p><p><b>C.

She had worked in the operating room of a Seattle hospital and, like many nurses, had developed back problems because of the long hours she spent on her feet and the labor involved in maneuvering and lifting patients. By 2011 her legs had started to hurt so badly that she required back surgery, which prevented her from returning to work. Helen wasn&#x2019;t worried about the loss of income. She had planned wisely for her retirement, enjoyed a solid credit rating, paid her bills on time, and owned her house outright. <br><br> Soon after she&#x2019;d recovered from surgery, her daughter in Portland, Oregon, started to suffer from health problems. Since Helen was now retired, she had time to travel to see her. She left her home and her dog in the care of her niece, Samantha. Helen asked Samantha to promise not to allow anyone else to stay in the house. She had had a bad experience fifteen years earlier, when the sister of one of her hospital coworkers stayed with her for a week. Using information she had found in Helen&#x2019;s home, the woman opened a credit card in Helen&#x2019;s name. After discover�ing the crime, Helen confronted the woman, who then paid off the debt and closed the account. But the event left an impression on Helen, and she didn&#x2019;t want any strangers in her house, espe�cially not while she was away. <br><br> When Helen returned home from visiting her daughter, she was understandably upset to see another woman staying there. When Helen asked Samantha about the stranger, she explained that the woman, Alice Lipski, was a friend who had had a fight with her boyfriend and needed a place to stay. It would just be for a few days, and Samantha didn&#x2019;t think Helen would mind. Well, Helen did mind, and asked that Alice be out of the house by the end of the week. She was right to feel uneasy. That feeling intensified when the branch manager of Helen&#x2019;s credit union called her to tell her someone had charged $300 on a debit card that Helen had never used before. Now her account was over�drawn. <br><br> Helen went to her credit union office to fill out a fraud affidavit, and the lost money was restored. But the problems con�tinued. A few days later, she received another phone call, this one from Wells Fargo. Had she just made $5,000 in charges on a credit card she&#x2019;d never used before? No, she hadn&#x2019;t. The card had apparently been activated from her home the week before, and the balance had been paid off with one of her own credit union checks. What was happening? Helen went back to her credit union. While looking over her account, the manager asked, &#x201c;Did you just pay $500 from this checking account toward your American Express card bill online?&#x201d; No, she hadn&#x2019;t. Helen didn&#x2019;t pay bills online. The manager told her to file a police report. <br><br> This was just the beginning of Helen&#x2019;s identity nightmare. While Helen was trying to plug up the widening hole in her credit problems, Alice Lipski was methodically <i>becoming </i>Helen Anderson. On top of what Alice had stolen from paperwork at the house, she had also found Helen&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s birthday through some basic social media sleuthing and an Internet background check. This information allowed Alice to negotiate the security questions and reactivate a canceled store card from Costco, set�ting new security answers that only Alice knew. In doing so, she effectively locked Helen out of her own account. She also signed Helen up for a credit-monitoring service. But instead of protect�ing Helen against ID theft, it gave Alice access to Helen&#x2019;s com�plete credit history. <br><br> The credit report contained a great deal of information about Helen&#x2019;s bank and store credit cards. Alice reported each card as lost or stolen and opened new replacement cards, each with a new and unique username and password. And then she started to use them. Next, she had photo IDs made up with her photo but Helen&#x2019;s info, so she could effectively impersonate Helen in real life, not just online. Then Alice instructed the U.S. Postal Service to forward Helen&#x2019;s mail to a post office box. Naturally, Alice used one of Helen&#x2019;s credit cards to pay the monthly fee. She also had a valid-looking driver&#x2019;s license made, and she had Helen&#x2019;s Social Security number, thanks to the new Medicare card Alice had received in the mail. (At the time, Medicare cards still listed Social Security numbers on them.) <br><br> It took a while for Helen to notice that she was no longer receiving checks and bills in the mail. And then more calls came in from credit card companies asking about suspicious transactions. &#x201c;I would call a card company and they would ask for the account number and password, and I couldn&#x2019;t give them either one,&#x201d; Helen said. She felt as if she were disappearing. She had to go to banks and stores in person and show them her driver&#x2019;s license in an effort to convince them she was who she said she was. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t prove who I was, because [Alice] could prove it easier than I could,&#x201d; she said. Helen would cancel cards and reset information when she could, and there would be peace . . . for a while. But then a whole new set of charges would appear. Helen believes that more than $30,000 was spent in her name&#x2014;at stores, restaurants, casinos, gas stations, and other places. <br><br> What Helen didn&#x2019;t know at the time was that Alice was spinning out of control. She was a methamphetamine addict. Law enforcement experts say there is a discernible link between meth addiction and ID theft. But eventually an addict&#x2019;s drug use escalates, making her more prone to make mistakes. Alice was writing bad checks on other stolen accounts to keep Helen&#x2019;s accounts from exceeding their limits. After Alice&#x2019;s boyfriend was arrested, she needed $10,000 to bail him out of jail. To get it, she drained Helen&#x2019;s credit union account, along with three other accounts stolen from other people. She also pledged equity in Helen&#x2019;s home to spring him from jail. Helen had no idea that her house, which she had lived in for forty years and owned outright, was in jeopardy until she received an angry call from a bail bond company. <br><br> &#x201c;I felt like I was a nonhuman being,&#x201d; said Helen. <br><br> The devastation that Helen felt is often the most damaging aspect of identity theft&#x2014;or any type of fraud. Even if you can get your money back and restore your credit ratings, what may never leave is the sense of violation that comes with the knowledge that your home, family, and personal information have been compromised. Experts say the effects of fraud on individuals are similar to the psychological aftermath experienced by victims of violent crimes and war, ranging from anxiety to emotional volatility, depression to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). <br><br> One night, Alice racked up $2,000 on one of Helen&#x2019;s accounts on a Macy&#x2019;s shopping spree. She was high, and in her haste to get out of the store, she left her purse on a chair. That handbag contained a meth pipe and all the tools of Alice&#x2019;s trade and proof of her deceit: a tablet computer with information about her victims, fraudulent credit cards, and ten Washington State driver&#x2019;s licenses in nine different names. Each one had Alice&#x2019;s picture on it. When she realized she had left her purse behind and went back to retrieve it, it was too late. The police had been called and were already trying to track her down, but she was able to flee the store before they arrived. <br><br> Ultimately, it took six weeks for officers to find and arrest Alice. They learned she had accumulated these tools of her trade over the span of a few months, and with the help of a small team of accomplices, including a man named Dino, who crafted fake IDs so authentic-looking they fooled experienced bank tellers, and another named Brian, who had the skills to calculate algorithms used to determine driver&#x2019;s license numbers, Alice was charged with ten counts of identity theft. She and her colleagues had stolen close to $1 million from Helen and other victims. Alice was successfully prosecuted but cut a deal that would limit her jail time if she successfully completed drug rehab. <br><br> The funds Alice had stolen were restored, because Helen filed the appropriate police reports, but her life will never be the same. Her financial future remains uncertain as she struggles to clean up her damaged credit. After this ordeal, she sold the house that she had called home for forty years and moved in with her elderly mother. Helen is often stymied by the arduous paperwork she needs to fill out to get credit bureaus to correct her record and is fatalistic about the possibility of future fraud. &#x201c;My information is out there for another scammer to use,&#x201d; she said. Unfortunately, this will always be the case. <br><br> Every year, millions of American consumers&#x2014;nearly 7 percent of the population&#x2014;are victims of scams and fraud. Criminals everywhere, from people in your own community to international rings, are looking for opportunities to take advantage of you. In 2017, the number of fraud victims in the United States reached 16.7 million, with $16.8 billion lost. Victims lose not just money; they can spend hours trying to resolve scams. And worse: Scams can alter and ruin lives. <br><br> In this book, I reveal the truth behind the methods used by the world&#x2019;s most skillful con artists to steal billions of dollars each year from unsuspecting consumers. And I give you very specific steps to protect yourself and your family. I&#x2019;m writing this book now because in my anti-fraud work I see how quickly scams and scammers are advancing. It&#x2019;s frightening. I also see firsthand how devastating fraud can be. <br> <i><br> Scam Me If You Can</i> draws on my own expertise working on the front lines to combat fraud. For more than forty-five years, I&#x2019;ve worked with, advised, and consulted with the FBI and hundreds of financial institutions, corporations, and government agencies around the world to help them in their fight against fraud. I also serve as the Fraud Watch Network Ambassador for AARP, a nonprofit with thirty- even million members. But my unusual blend of knowledge and expertise began more than fifty years ago, in an unusual way: I was one of the world&#x2019;s most famous con men. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>The Suburban Micro-Farm: Modern Solutions for Busy People</h2><p><b>Nonfiction Book Awards 2018 Gold Winner</b><b>Foreword INDIE Awards 2018 Gold Winner (Hobbies &amp; Home category)</b><b>Nautilus Book Awards 2018 Silver Winner (Green Living &amp; Sustainability category)</b><br><i><i></i>Reduce your lawn and your grocery budget.

Alienated from society and paralysed by a sense of his own insignificance, the anonymous narrator of Dostoyevsky&#39;s groundbreaking Notes from Underground tells the story of his tortured life. With bitter irony, he describes his refusal to become a worker in the &#39;anthill&#39; of society and his gradual withdrawal to an existence &#39;underground&#39;. The seemingly ordinary world of St Petersburg takes on a nightmarish quality in The Double when a government clerk encounters a man who looks exactly like him - his double, perhaps, or possibly the darker side of his own personality. Like Notes from Underground, this is a masterly tragicomic study of human consciousness. Ronald Wilks&#39;s extraordinary new translation is accompanied here by an introduction by Robert Louis Jackson discussing these pivotal works in the context of Dostoyevsky&#39;s life and times. This edition also contains a chronology, bibliography, table of ranks and notes on each work. Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky (1821-1881) was born in Moscow. From 1849-54 he lived in a convict prison, and in later years his passion for gambling led him deeply into debt. His other works available in Penguin Classics include Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, The Idiot and Demons. If you enjoyed Notes from Underground and The Double, you might like Dostoyevsky&#39;s Demons, also available in Penguin Classics. &#39;Notes from Underground, with its mood of intellectual irony and alienation, can be seen as the first modern novel ... That sense of meaninglessness of existence that runs through much of twentieth-century writing - from Conrad and Kafka, to Beckett and beyond - starts in Dostoyevsky&#39;s work&#39; Malcolm Bradbury</p><p>Moscow-born Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky (1821-1881) served time in a convict prison for his political alliances, and in his later years his passion for gambling led him deeply into debt. His novels include The Devils and The Brothers Karamazov. Ronald Wilks has translated numerous volumes for the Classics, including most recently Chekhov&#39;s stories and forthcoming editions of Tolstoy&#39;s stories, and Gogol&#39;s stories and plays.Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>Mothers, Daughters, and Body Image: Learning to Love Ourselves as We Are</h2><p><b>Discover why women are so often unhappy with their appearance&#x2014;and how they <i>can</i> learn to love themselves.</b><br><br>When women are told that what is important about us is how we look, it becomes increasingly difficult for us to feel comfortable with our appearance and how we feel about our bodies. We are told, over and over&#x2014;if we just lost weight, fit into those old jeans, or into a new smaller pair&#x2014;we will be happier and feel better about ourselves. The truth is, so many women despise their appearance, weight, and shape, that experts who study women&#x2019;s body image now consider this feeling to be normal.&nbsp;<br> <br>But it does not have to be that way. It <i>is</i> possible for us as women to love ourselves, our bodies, as we are. We need a new story about what it means to be a woman in this world. Based on her original research, Hillary L McBride shares the true stories of young women, and their mothers, and provides unique insights into how our relationships with our bodies are shaped by what we see around us and the specific things we can do to have healthier relationships with our appearance, and all the other parts of ourselves that make us women.&nbsp;<br> <br>In <i>Mothers, Daughters, and Body Image</i> McBride tells her own story of recovery from an eating disorder, and how her struggles led her to dream of a new vision for womanhood&#x2014;from one without body shame, negative comparisons, or insecurities, to one of freedom, connection, and acceptance.&nbsp;</p><p>Hillary McBride is a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia in Counselling Psychology where she is continuing research she started for her masters, exploring women&#x2019;s experiences in and of the body, particularly at significant transitions points. McBride sees patients privately where for a variety of concerns, including acute mental health issues. She works regularly with people struggling with depression, anxiety, life transitions, self-harm, abuse, relationship issues, and sexuality. She specializes in women&#x2019;s issues from a feminist perspective. McBride has designed body image presentations for young girls and their mothers that she presents regularly in schools and community settings. She regularly speaks on radio, podcasts, and at workshops on a variety of mental health topics including sexuality, body image, well-being, living authentically, and healing trauma.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Listen to Jazz</h2><p><b>An acclaimed music scholar presents an accessible introduction to the art of listening to jazz</b><br><br> In <i>How to Listen to Jazz</i>, award-winning music scholar Ted Gioia presents a lively introduction to one of America's premier art forms.

This proves only that they do not know the desert.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Deep within the dunes dwell small insects that weave nets to trap one another, and burrowing snakes with scales the color of stones so that no hunter can find them. Seeds and spores from long-dead plants lie dormant in the warmth, waiting for the rainfall that comes once a year, or decade, or century, when they will burst into verdant life as brief as it is glorious. The heat of the suns sinks into the grains of sand until they glow, containing all the energy and possibility to become glass the color of jewels. All of these sing individual notes in the one great song of the Whills. <br> &nbsp;<br> No place is barren of the Force, and they who are one with the Force can always find the possibility of life. <br> &nbsp;<br> Awareness precedes consciousness. The warmth is luxuriated in and drawn upon before the mind is cognizant of doing so. Next comes the illusion of linear time. Only then does a sense of individuality arise, a remembrance of what was and what is, a knowledge of one&#x2019;s self as separate from the Force. It provides a vantage point for experiencing the physical world in its complexity and ecstasy, but the pain of that separation is endurable only because unity will come again, and soon. <br> &nbsp;<br> That fracture from the all, that memory of temporal existence, is most easily summed up with the word the fracture was once called by. The name. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;Qui-Gon.&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> The name is spoken by another. Qui-Gon has been summoned. He draws upon his memories of himself and takes shape, reassembling the form he last had in life. It seems to him that he feels flesh wrap around bones, hair and skin over flesh, robes over skin&#x2014;and then, as naturally to him as though he had done so yesterday, he pulls down the hood of his Jedi cloak and looks upon his Padawan. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Obi-Wan.&#x201d; It is worth the travail of individual existence just to say that name again. So he says the other name, too. &#x201c;Ben.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Obi-Wan Kenobi&#x2019;s hair has turned white. Lines have etched their traces along his forehead, around his blue eyes. He wears Jedi robes so worn and ragged as to be indistinguishable from the garb of the impoverished hermit he pretends to be. Most would walk past this man without a second glance. Yet while Qui-Gon perceives the physical realities of Obi-Wan&#x2019;s appearance, he is not limited to human sight any longer. He also sees the confident general of the Clone Wars, the strong young Padawan who followed his master into battle, even the rebellious little boy at the Temple that no Master was in any hurry to train. They are all equally part of Obi-Wan, each stage of his existence vivid in this moment. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You are afraid,&#x201d; Qui-Gon says. He knows why; the events taking place around them are clearer to him than they are to Obi-Wan. &#x201c;You seek your center. You need balance.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The living find it difficult not to tell the dead that which they already know. Obi-Wan doesn&#x2019;t even try. &#x201c;There may be Imperial stormtroopers waiting for Luke at the Lars farm. If so&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then you will rescue him.&#x201d; Qui-Gon smiles. &#x201c;Or he may rescue himself. Or the sister will find the brother instead.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Obi-Wan cannot be so easily comforted. &#x201c;Or he could be killed. Cut down while still hardly more than a boy.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> To Qui-Gon, all human lives now seem impossibly brief. Years are irrelevant. It is journeys through the Force that matter. Some must struggle for that knowledge through many decades; others are very nearly born with it. Most never begin the journey at all, no matter how long they live. <br> &nbsp;<br> But Luke Skywalker . . . <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Luke has a great journey yet to go,&#x201d; Qui-Gon says. &#x201c;It does not end here.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve seen this?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Qui-Gon nods. This relieves Obi-Wan more than it should, because he cannot guess the shape that journey will take. <br> &nbsp;<br> Their surroundings in the physical world become clearer&#x2014;the endless dunes of Tatooine stretching out in every direction, a smoldering sandcrawler a hulk behind them, a dozen tiny Jawas dead. The memory of their fear and helplessness lances Qui-Gon&#x2019;s consciousness, as does the meaninglessness of their deaths. Although Obi-Wan has been tending to the bodies, for the moment the Jawas are seen to only by two droids. The droids comfort Qui-Gon somewhat, because they are familiar; the Force has even seen fit to bring these two back to the place where it all began. <br> &nbsp;<br> Time is a circle. The beginning is the end.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Obi-Wan murmurs, &#x201c;Bail Organa sent Leia herself to summon me. When I saw her&#x2014;saw Padm� in her so strongly, and even a little of Anakin, too&#x2014;I knew my exile was nearly at an end. Would you believe I find it difficult to let it go?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve adapted. You&#x2019;ve had to. No wonder that the desert feels like home to you now, or that being a Jedi Knight has become foreign. But that can change, and faster than you might dream possible.&#x201d; It will in fact be almost instantaneous, a transformation begun and completed the first time immediate danger beckons again. Qui-Gon looks forward to witnessing it. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve waited for this day for a very long time,&#x201d; Obi-Wan says. &#x201c;So long it feels as though I&#x2019;ve waited for it my entire life. To have it endangered&#x2014;now, just as the great work begins&#x2014;so many factors are in play. The future is difficult to know, even more so than before.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you truly think your work has only just begun, my Padawan?&#x201d; They have begun using that title between them again, in recognition of how much more Obi-Wan has yet to learn. It is strange, still, to think of death as only the beginning of wisdom. <br> &nbsp;<br> Obi-Wan considers. &#x201c;There were other great endeavors. Other challenges. But the Clone Wars were long ago. For nearly two decades, I have been little more than a shadow waiting to become a Jedi Knight again.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Qui-Gon shakes his head. Already his physical self feels natural enough to him that he can express thought and emotion through gestures. &#x201c;Battles and wars aren&#x2019;t the measure of a Jedi. Anyone can fight, given a weapon and an enemy. Anyone can use a lightsaber, given due training or even good luck. But to stand and wait&#x2014;to have so much patience and fortitude&#x2014;that, Obi-Wan, is a greater achievement than you can know. Few could have accomplished it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Fewer still could have done so without turning to darkness. Sometimes, when Qui-Gon considers it, he is awed by his student&#x2019;s steadfastness. Every person Obi-Wan ever truly loved&#x2014;Anakin, Satine, Padm�, and Qui-Gon himself&#x2014;came to a terrible end. Three of them died before his eyes; the other fell to a fate so bleak that death would&#x2019;ve been a gift. The Jedi Order that provided the entire framework for Obi-Wan&#x2019;s life was consumed by betrayal and slaughter. Every step of this long, unfulfilling journey is one Obi-Wan had to take alone . . . and yet he never faltered. As the rest of the galaxy burned, his path remained true. It is the kind of victory that most people never recognize and yet the bedrock all goodness is built upon. <br> &nbsp;<br> Even Obi-Wan doesn&#x2019;t see it. &#x201c;You see me in a kinder light than most would, old friend.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I owe you that. After all, I&#x2019;m the one who failed you.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Failed me?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> They have never spoken of this, not once in all Qui-Gon&#x2019;s journeys into the mortal realm to commune with him. This is primarily because Qui-Gon thought his mistakes so wretched, so obvious, that Obi-Wan had wanted to spare him any discussion of it. Yet here, too, he has failed to do his Padawan justice. <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &nbsp;&#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t ready to be a Jedi Master,&#x201d; Qui-Gon admits. &#x201c;You hadn&#x2019;t even been knighted when I forced you to promise to train Anakin. Teaching a student so powerful, so old, so unused to our ways . . . that might&#x2019;ve been beyond the reach of the greatest of us. To lay that burden at your feet when you were hardly more than a boy&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Anakin became a Jedi Knight,&#x201d; Obi-Wan interjects, a thread of steel in his voice. &#x201c;He served valiantly in the Clone Wars. His fall to darkness was more his choice than anyone else&#x2019;s failure. Yes, I bear some responsibility&#x2014;and perhaps you do, too&#x2014;but Anakin had the training and the wisdom to choose a better path. He did not.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> All true. None of it any absolution for Qui-Gon&#x2019;s own mistakes. But it is Obi-Wan who needs guidance now. These things can be discussed another time, when they&#x2019;re beyond crude human language. <br> &nbsp;<br> Soon&#x2014;very soon.</p><h2>War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage</h2><p>The myth of the peace-loving "noble savage" is persistent and pernicious. Indeed, for the last fifty years, most popular and scholarly works have agreed that prehistoric warfare was rare, harmless, unimportant, and, like smallpox, a disease of civilized societies alone. Prehistoric warfare, according to this view, was little more than a ritualized game, where casualties were limited and the effects of aggression relatively mild. Lawrence Keeley's groundbreaking <em>War Before Civilization</em> offers a devastating rebuttal to such comfortable myths and debunks the notion that warfare was introduced to primitive societies through contact with civilization (an idea he denounces as "the pacification of the past").<br> Building on much fascinating archeological and historical research and offering an astute comparison of warfare in civilized and prehistoric societies, from modern European states to the Plains Indians of North America, <em>War Before Civilization</em> convincingly demonstrates that prehistoric warfare was in fact more deadly, more frequent, and more ruthless than modern war. To support this point, Keeley provides a wide-ranging look at warfare and brutality in the prehistoric world. He reveals, for instance, that prehistorical tactics favoring raids and ambushes, as opposed to formal battles, often yielded a high death-rate; that adult males falling into the hands of their enemies were almost universally killed; and that surprise raids seldom spared even women and children. Keeley cites evidence of ancient massacres in many areas of the world, including the discovery in South Dakota of a prehistoric mass grave containing the remains of over 500 scalped and mutilated men, women, and children (a slaughter that took place a century and a half before the arrival of Columbus). In addition, Keeley surveys the prevalence of looting, destruction, and trophy-taking in all kinds of warfare and again finds little moral distinction between ancient warriors and civilized armies. Finally, and perhaps most controversially, he examines the evidence of cannibalism among some preliterate peoples.<br> Keeley is a seasoned writer and his book is packed with vivid, eye-opening details (for instance, that the homicide rate of prehistoric Illinois villagers may have exceeded that of the modern United States by some 70 times). But he also goes beyond grisly facts to address the larger moral and philosophical issues raised by his work. What are the causes of war? Are human beings inherently violent? How can we ensure peace in our own time? Challenging some of our most dearly held beliefs, Keeley's conclusions are bound to stir controversy.<br></p><p>Throughout much of this century the notion has been gaining ground, bolstered by genocide and Holocaust, that modern warfare is more barbaric than war has ever been. Alongside this view has grown a romantic impression that primitive cultures were, and are, more peaceful. Lawrence Keeley, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois, aims to dispel this inversion of the connotations of &#34;civilization.&#34; He cites the historical evidence that humans have always been just as bloodthirsty as they are today, and that indeed in the days when death was less clinical it was often nastier. War, it seems, has always been with us.<br> <strong>Lawrence H. Keeley</strong> is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He has contributed articles to <em>Scientific American</em> and <em>Nature</em>, and has appeared in documentaries that have run on PBS, The Discovery Channel and The Learning Channel. He lives in Oak Park, Illinois with his wife and son.<br></p><h2>The Wretched Stone</h2><p>In a story recounted through the daily log of Captain Allan Hope, the sailors aboard the Rita Anne become mesmerized and transformed by a mysterious glowing rock, and only music and books can restore them to normal.</p><p><p><b>Chris Van Allsburg </b>is the winner of two Caldecott Medals, for <i>Jumanji </i>and <i>The Polar Express</i>, as well as the recipient of a Caldecott Honor Book for <i>The Garden of Abdul Gasazi</i>.

Visit him at&nbsp;chrisvanallsburg.com.&nbsp;</p>Grade 2-4-- Van Allsburg's latest offering may be seen as preachy or provocative, allegorical or obvious, but like much of his previous work, it is bound to attract attention and stimulate discussion. Written in the form of a ship's log, the book outlines the unusual events that take place aboard the Rita Anne after the discovery of a glowing stone on a mysterious, deserted island. In a few brief entries, Captain Randall Ethan Hope notes his initial pleasure in the cultured and convivial crew, details the finding of the luminous stone, and divulges its terrible transformative effect--his shipmates have been turned into primates. When a sudden storm blows up, the Captain expects the worst. However, the ship survives long enough for the men to be rehabilitated and subsequently rescued. The stone is sent to the bottom of the sea by Captain Hope and all on board swear themselves to secrecy. The dramatic illustrations increase the suspense and surprise inherent in the unlikely adventures described. Visual humor, although used sparingly, also adds to the appeal of the colorful paintings. While this picture book could be read merely as an exotic ocean adventure, literacy advocates and fans of book discussions will enjoy ruminating over the symbolism of the mysterious glowing stone and arguing over the interpretation of Van Allsburg's oblique message. --Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Brida: A Novel (P.S.)</h2><p><p> Brida, a young Irish girl, has long been interested in various aspects of magic but is searching for something more.

How easy it is to simply rush headlong through our lives, slaves to our daily obligations, and in the process race our children through their childhood. But there is a better way... In Mitten Strings for God, Katrina Kenison shares her own search for a more satisfying balance in her life. The result is a lyrical and tender series of reflections, interwoven with gentle suggestions and advice, that remind us what happens when we slow down and are fully present in our lives. Suddenly there is room for joy and play and intimacy, space for wonder and reverie, and time to awaken to the beauty of the world and discover the sacred in the ordinary. Tranquil in our own hearts and minds, we can offer our children the one thing they need more than anything else: us. And we receive something priceless in return-the chance to savor our lives and the precious people in them.</p><p>In an age when "keeping up with the Joneses" refers not only to material riches but also to a whirlwind of activities, author Katrina Kenison humbly asks, "Just whose standards am I living by, anyway?" Kenison, mother of two sons and former annual editor of <i>The Best American Short Stories</i> anthology since 1990, understands the hectic agendas, short tempers, and full-time careers today's families endure. But she has also learned to limit the chaos. The title comes from Kenison's youngest son, Jack, cuddled up with mom one quiet afternoon as she crochets mitten strings. He holds up a long piece of yarn and proclaims, "I'm knitting a mitten string for God"--a sweet phrase, but a bit misleading. Despite a sprinkling of minor religious references, the larger focus of Kenison's beautifully written first book lies in living with care and awareness. Chapters with titles like "Grace," "Healing," "Spirit," and "Breathing" offer soothing pictures of a family life that honors patience, imagination, and Sundays without plans. Kenison weaves together personal stories and wisdom from such philosophers as Thoreau and Anne Morrow Lindbergh; the graceful resulting tapestry shows how peace and simplicity can be savored in a world hell-bent on pushing people to accomplish more, own more, and do it all as quickly as possible. <i>--Liane Thomas</i>Katrina Kenison is the author of <i>The Gift of an Ordinary Day: A Mother's Memoir </i>(Springboard Press, 2009).

He quickly realized that Katrina was not the most interesting thing about New Orleans, not by a long shot. The most interesting question, which struck him as he watched residents struggling to return, was this: Why are New Orleanians&#x2014;along with people from all over the world who continue to flock there&#x2014;so devoted to a place that was, even before the storm, the most corrupt, impoverished, and violent corner of America? </p><p>Here&#x2019;s the answer. <i>Nine Lives</i> is a multivoiced biography of this dazzling, surreal, and imperiled city through the lives of nine characters over forty years and bracketed by two epic storms: Hurricane Betsy, which transformed the city in the 1960&#x2019;s, and Katrina, which nearly destroyed it. These nine lives are windows into every strata of one of the most complex and fascinating cities in the world. From outsider artists and Mardi Gras Kings to jazz-playing coroners and transsexual barkeeps, these lives are possible only in New Orleans, but the city that nurtures them is also, from the beginning, a city haunted by the possibility of disaster. All their stories converge in the storm, where some characters rise to acts of heroism and others sink to the bottom. But it is New Orleans herself&#x2014;perpetually whistling past the grave yard&#x2014;that is the story&#x2019;s real heroine.</p> <p><i>Nine Lives</i> is narrated from the points of view of some of New Orleans&#x2019;s most charismatic characters, but underpinning the voices of the city is an extraordinary feat of reporting that allows Baum to bring this kaleidoscopic portrait to life with brilliant color and crystalline detail. Readers will find themselves wrapped up in each of these individual dramas and delightfully immersed in the life of one of this country&#x2019;s last unique places, even as its ultimate devastation looms ever closer. By resurrecting this beautiful and tragic place and portraying the extraordinary lives that could have taken root only there, <i>Nine Lives</i> shows us what was lost in the storm and what remains to be saved. </p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Dan Baum on <i>Nine Lives</i></strong><br><br> Hurricane Katrina was the kind of event a reporter waits his entire life to cover. It was especially satisfying doing so for <i>The New Yorker</i>. While newspaper and television reporters chased about feverishly in their attempt to feed the insatiable daily news monster, I enjoyed the time to go deep and peel back the tragedy in all its complexity. I wrote half a dozen short &#x201c;Talk of the Town&#x201d; pieces and two long articles over the following year. <br> <p>Even working for <i>The New Yorker</i>, though, covering Katrina and its aftermath became frustrating. The longer I stayed in New Orleans, the more I understood that huge as Katrina was, it is hardly the most interesting thing about New Orleans. New Orleans is the most unusual place I&#x2019;ve ever been&#x2014;complicated, sensual, self-contradictory, hilarious, infuriating&#x2014;and it was the place itself, not the tragedy that befell it, that I wanted to write about.</p> <p>So when my wife and I thought about writing a book, it wasn&#x2019;t a &#x201c;Katrina book&#x201d; we had in mind. We finally settled on interweaving the life stories of nine New Orleanians&#x2014;rich and poor and in between, black and white and in between, male and female and in between. <i>Nine Lives</i> begins in 1965, right after the last time a big part of the city flooded during a hurricane. By this we want to say: New Orleans was there a long time before Hurricane Katrina and it will be there a long time after. Katrina doesn&#x2019;t show up in <i>Nine Lives</i> until past page 200. </p> <p>We had two guiding principles: No bad guys, and all happy endings. All nine of these people are, in their own way, heroes. And while we could have ended any of their stories on a down note, we instead end all at a moment of ascendance. There are many ways of looking at New Orleans, but this is how we chose to do so in <i>Nine Lives</i>.</p> <p>We were careful not to make <i>Nine Lives</i> the kind of "issue" book one must read to understand current events. We want people to read it for the same reason they read <i>The Kite Runner</i> or <i>The Bridges of Madison County</i>&#x2014;out of love of the characters and a warm, delicious eagerness to see their lives unfold. New Orleans is above all, a fun place, and we tried to make <i>Nine Lives</i> as much fun to read. <i>&#x2014;Dan Baum</i></p>Dan Baum&nbsp;is a former staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i>, and has written for numerous other magazines and newspapers.

Our edition reproduces the numerous illustrations, maps and charts in full size, so that all text is legible. Larkin believed that God laid it on his heart to prepare a work on Dispensational Truth (or God&#39;s Plan and Purpose in the Ages), illustrated with many maps, charts and descriptive matter. After more than three years efforts, mostly designing and drawing the charts and illustrations, the book was extremely well received in 1918 and remains to this day a much used spiritual guide. As a result of its success and wide circulation, the first edition was soon sold out, and subsequently followed by a second edition, and later, with a revised edition.</p><p></p><h2>Medical Astrology for Health Practitioners: A Healer&#39;s Guide</h2><p><p><strong>This basic layman's text allows the medical practitioner, astrologer or layman to quickly understand basic medical astrology.</strong> <strong>World renowned astrologer and award winning writer Judith Hill introduces a few extremely fruitful methods for immediate use to health professionals</strong>, i.e. "what every physician should know".

In <i>My Wicked, Wicked Ways</i>, Flynn reveals himself to be a self-aware and cosmopolitan devotee of excitement and pleasure. With gusto, he recalls his years as a soldier of fortune in the South Seas, his trip to war-torn Spain, his battles in Hollywood with studio honchos (Jack Warner was a particular nemesis) and ex-wives (esp. Lili Damita), and the furor surrounding his trial for rape in 1943. Freely mixing verbal abuse and tall tales with candid confessions, Flynn's autobiography makes for one hell of a read.</p><p>12 1.5-hour cassettesErrol Flynn (1909-1959) starred in 53 films including <i>The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Sea Hawk</i>, and <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>.

Feeling unfulfilled, burned out, or just plain unhappy with what we&#x2019;re doing, we long to make that leap into the unknown. But we also hold on, white-knuckled, to the years of time and effort we&#x2019;ve invested in our current profession.<br><br>In this powerful book, Herminia Ibarra presents a new model for career reinvention that flies in the face of everything we&#x2019;ve learned from "career experts." While common wisdom holds that we must first know what we want to do before we can act, Ibarra argues that this advice is backward. Knowing, she says, is the result of doing and experimenting. Career transition is not a straight path toward some predetermined identity, but a crooked journey along which we try on a host of "possible selves" we might become.<br><br>Based on her in-depth research on professionals and managers in transition, Ibarra outlines an active process of career reinvention that leverages three ways of "working identity": experimenting with new professional activities, interacting in new networks of people, and making sense of what is happening to us in light of emerging possibilities.<br><br>Through engrossing stories from a literature professor turned stockbroker to an investment banker turned novelist Ibarra reveals a set of guidelines that all successful reinventions share. She explores specific ways that hopeful career changers of any background can:<br><br>Explore possible selves<br>Craft and execute "identity experiments"<br>Create "small wins" that keep momentum going<br>Survive the rocky period between career identities<br>Connect with role models and mentors who can ease the transition<br>Make time for reflection without missing out on windows of opportunity<br>Decide when to abandon the old path in order to follow the new<br>Arrange new events into a coherent story of who we are becoming.<br><br>A call to the dreamer in each of us, <i>Working Identity</i> explores the process for crafting a more fulfilling future. Where we end up may surprise us.<br></p><p>"Herminia Ibarra has written one of the year&#x2019;s most important business books. Sophisticated and savvy, it challenges much of the conventional wisdom about how and why people change careers&#x2014;and illuminates the experimentation, struggle, and joy that are essential to the process. For professionals contemplating a career change, Working Identity is essential reading." <br>&#x2014;Daniel H. Pink, author of Free Agent Nation <p>"Through countless stories that inspire because they come so close to our own, Ibarra provides a world-shifting breakthrough in how we can go about refining our lives and changing our careers. She has given us long-awaited, enormously practical, and deeply insightful wisdom about the improvisational nature of our selves and our professional development." <br>&#x2014;Ronald A. Heifetz, Cofounder, The Center for Public Leadership, Harvard University, Kennedy School of Government and coauthor of Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive through the Dangers of Leading </p><p>"Career and life transitions are as certain as death and taxes, and we are prone to face them with the same fear and anxiety. Working Identity affords us the courage of common sense. Ibarra's in-depth research and sharp insights show that successful transitions occur one step at a time, by trial and error, experimentation, and incremental experience." <br>&#x2014;Randy Komisar, Virtual CEO and author of The Monk and the Riddle </p><p>"Working Identity is one of those rare and wonderful books that combines deep knowledge drawn from careful research with practical ideas that can be put to immediate use. The book&#x2019;s message of hope and possibility&#x2014;that it is possible to reinvent careers and lives&#x2014;should be embraced by everyone thinking about transitions in today&#x2019;s turbulent world." <br>&#x2014;Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard Business School, author of World Class and Evolve: Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow</p>Herminia Ibarra is Professor of Organizational Behavior at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France.</p><h2>Into Africa: The Epic Adventures of Stanley and Livingstone</h2><p><b>What really happened to Dr. David Livingstone?

Epidemic of Mystery&nbsp;</b><br><br>"Are any of your patients dying?" asked Yakov Klipnitzer when he called Margarita Ilyenko on Wednesday, April 4, 1979. She was chief physician at No. 24, a medium-sized, one-hundred-bed hospital in Sverdlovsk, a Soviet industrial metropolis in the Ural Mountains. Her hospital often referred patients to a larger facility, No. 20, where Klip�nitzer was chief doctor. Klipnitzer saw two unusual deaths from what looked like severe pneumonia. The patients, he told Ilyenko, were "two of yours." No, Ilyenko told him, she did not know of any deaths. The next day he called again. Klipnitzer was more persistent. "You still don't have any patients dying?" he asked. Klipnitzer had new deaths with pneumonia-like symptoms. "Who is dying from pneumonia today?" Ilyenko replied, incredulous. "It is very rare." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, patients began to die at Ilyenko's hospital, too. They were brought in ambulances and cars, suffering from high fevers, headaches, coughs, vomiting, chills and chest pains. They were stumbling in the hall�ways and lying on gurneys. The head of admissions at Hospital No. 20, Roza Gaziyeva, was on duty overnight between April 5 and 6. "Some of them who felt better after first aid tried to go home. They were later found on the streets&#x2014;the people had lost consciousness," she recalled. She tried to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to one ill patient, who died. "During the night, we had four people die. I could hardly wait until morning. I was frightened." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of April 6, Ilyenko raced to the hospital, threw her bag into her office, put on her white gown and headed for the ward. One patient looked up at her, eyes open, and then died. "There are dead bod�ies, people still alive, lying together. I thought, this is a nightmare. Some�thing is very, very wrong." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death came quickly to victims. Ilyenko reported to the district public health board that she had an emergency. Instructions came back to her that another hospital, No. 40, was being set up to receive all the patients in an infectious disease ward. The word spread&#x2014;<i>infection!</i>&#x2014;and with it, fear. Some staff refused to report for work, and others already at work refused to go home so as not to expose their families. Then, disinfection workers arrived at hospital No. 20, wearing hazardous materials suits. They spread chlorine everywhere, which was a standard disinfectant, but the scene was terrifying, Ilyenko recalled. "There was panic when people saw them."(1) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sverdlovsk, population 1.2 million, was the tenth-largest city in the Soviet Union and the heartland of its military-industrial complex. Guns, steel, industry and some of the best mechanical engineering schools in the Soviet Union were Sverdlovsk's legacy from Stalin's rush to modernize during World War II and after. Since 1976, the region had been run by a young, ambitious party secretary, Boris Yeltsin. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospitals No. 20 and 24 were in the southern end of the city, which slopes downward from the center. Streets lined with small wooden cot�tages and high fences were broken up by stark five-story apartment buildings, shops and schools. The Chkalovsky district, where Ilyenko's hospital was located, included a ceramics factory where hundreds of men worked in shifts in a cavernous building with large, high windows. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than a mile away, to the north-northwest, was Compound 32, an army base for two tank divisions, largely residences, and, adjacent to it, a closed military microbiology facility. Compound 19, which comprised a laboratory, development and testing center for deadly pathogens, includ�ing anthrax, was run by the 15th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense. On Monday April 2, 1979, from morning until early evening, the wind was blowing down from Compound 19 toward the ceramics factory.(2)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Inside Compound 19, three shifts operated around the clock, experiment�ing with anthrax and making it in batches. Anthrax bacteria were grown in fermentation vessels, separated from the liquid growth medium and dried before they were ground up into a fine powder for use in aerosol form. Workers at the compound were regularly given vaccinations. The work was high risk. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anthrax is an often-fatal infection that occurs when spores of the bac�teria <i>Bacillus anthracis </i>enter the body, either through the skin, ingestion or inhalation. The bacteria germinate and release toxins that can quickly bring on death if untreated. In Russia, the disease was known as <i>Sibirskaya yazva</i>, or Siberian ulcer, because of the black sores that form when it is contracted through cuts in the skin. In nature, the disease most commonly spreads through contact with infected animals, usually graz�ing animals such as cows, goats and sheep, which ingest the spores from the soil. The inhalation variety is dangerous to humans. Breathing the spores into the lungs can kill those infected if not treated. A single gram of anthrax contains around a trillion spores. Odorless and colorless, the spores are extremely stable, and can remain dormant for as long as fifty years or more. For these reasons, anthrax was well suited for a biological weapon. According to one estimate, 112 pounds of anthrax spores released along a 1.2-mile line upwind of a city of 500,000 residents would result in 125,000 infections&#x2014;and kill 95,000 people.(3)<br>What exactly happened at Compound 19 is still unknown. By one account, a filter was removed and not properly replaced, and anthrax spores were released into the air.(4) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the south, sheep and cattle in villages began to die. Anthrax had been present in rural areas in the past, although it was not common. At the same time, people started getting sick. The first records of those admitted to hospitals came on Wednesday, April 4, when Ilyenko got Klipnitzer's phone call. "What was strange for us, it was mainly men dying, not many women, and not a single child," she said.(5) Ilyenko began keeping records of names, ages, addresses and possible reasons for the deaths, but she didn't know what was happening, or why. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On April 10, as the crisis deepened, Faina Abramova, a retired pathol�ogist who had been a lecturer at the Sverdlovsk Medical Institute, was summoned to Hospital No. 40 and asked to autopsy a thirty-seven-year�old man who died over the weekend. He had been at Compound 32, the army base with the tank divisions, for reserve duty, gone home to a nearby village and, for no apparent reason, became suddenly ill. Abram �ova, a spirited professional, was puzzled by the case. The man did not show classic signs of influenza and pneumonia. But the autopsy showed infection of the lymph nodes and the lungs. Abramova had also noticed the man suffered from cerebral bleeding, a distinctive red ring around the brain known as "cardinal's cap."(6) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We started thinking what other diseases may cause this pathology," she recalled. "We looked up the books, and we went through them all together, and it looked like anthrax." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That evening, Abramova attended a reception, which was also attended by Lev Grinberg, her prot�g�, a young pathologist with thick glasses, black hair and a beard. As they danced at the reception, Abramova whispered to him that she had autopsied the man earlier that day, and diagnosed his death as anthrax. Grinberg was stunned. "I asked, where in our godforsaken Sverdlovsk can we have anthrax?" he recalled. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, Grinberg saw the evidence for himself. He was instructed to go to Ilyenko's hospital. "I saw a horrible picture," he recalled. "It was three women, they had identical changes, sharp hemor�rhagic changes in their lungs, in the lymph nodes, and the tissue of lymph nodes was hemorrhaging." Abramova took samples and materials from the autopsies. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Word of the outbreak reached Moscow. Late on April 11, Vladimir Nikiforov, a chief of the infectious diseases department at the Central Postgraduate Institute, located within the Botkin Hospital in Moscow, arrived in Sverdlovsk. Also arriving in the city was Pyotr Burgasov, the Soviet deputy minister of health, who had once worked at Compound 19, in the 1950s. On April 12, at 2 P.M., Nikiforov assembled all the doctors who had been involved and asked for their observations and the autop�sies. Abramova was last to speak. She told him: anthrax. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nikiforov, an eminent, courtly scientist who had studied anthrax throughout his career, announced that he agreed with her. He reassured the doctors it could not spread from human to human. But from where had it come? Burgasov declared the source was contaminated meat from a village located 9.3 miles from the city. No one spoke up. No one knew for sure; the uncertainty was frightening. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Chkalovsky's neighborhoods, residents were told to watch out for contaminated meat. A widespread vaccination program began; accord�ing to Ilyenko's notes, 42,065 people were vaccinated in the days that fol�lowed. Broadsheet leaflets dated April 18 were distributed warning people not to buy meat outside the stores, to watch out for anthrax symp�toms such as headaches, fever, cold and cough followed by abdominal pains and high temperatures, and not to slaughter animals without per�mission.(7) Buildings and trees were washed by local fire brigades, stray dogs shot by police and unpaved streets covered with fresh asphalt. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ilyenko wrote in her notes on April 20, "358 got sick. 45 died. 214 in Hospital 40." She was not asked to relinquish her notes, and kept them at home. The 45 who died at her hospital were only part of the story; the total number of deaths from anthrax was more than 60 people. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carried by the steady wind, the spores floated through the ceramics factory, south of Compound 19. Vladlen Krayev, chief engineer, was present when the outbreak began among his 2,180 employees. He recalled that the factory had a ventilator that sucked air from outside, pumping it into furnaces, and provided ventilation for the workers. In the first weeks, about eighteen factory workers died. The crisis stretched on for seven weeks, much longer than might be expected, given the two-to-seven-day incubation period for anthrax described in textbooks at the time.(8) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grinberg recalled that Nikiforov made an unusual decision, ordering that all the dead be autopsied even though government regulations pro�hibited autopsy for anthrax victims because the spores can spread. As Grinberg and Abramova worked through the long days, the two pathol�ogists began to take notes out of sight. They wrote these notes on cards, and sometimes they wrote the official reports on carbon paper and kept the copies. "No one checked," Abramova recalled. The head of the regional health department came and told them "not to talk too much about it, and don't discuss it on the phone." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They conducted forty-two autopsies. They saw anthrax had damaged the lungs and lymph nodes. Grinberg said he suspected inhalation anthrax but didn't know for sure. "Perhaps we didn't know definitely, but we were not talking about it much. Honestly speaking, we were very tired, it was hard work, we had a feeling, myself for example, as if we were working under war conditions. They were feeding us, bringing us meals, to the center at No. 40. There was a huge amount of chlorine. Dis�infection was done every day. And we were going home on the trams after the working shift, and people were rushing away because we smelled of chlorine. The way I remember it, on the 10th day, about the end of the second week, we were thinking about keeping this material, that it should be preserved and studied." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it was prohibited, Grinberg persuaded a friend who was a photographer to secretly take color photographs of the autopsies using East German slide film. Abramova also preserved tissue samples. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In May, as the crisis eased, Nikiforov assembled all those who had par�ticipated in the hospital work and told them: the anthrax had come from tainted meat. But quietly, he told Abramova to keep investigating. He played a double game. In public, he was an official of the state, and loyal to the official story. But he also gave the pathologists a private signal to hide and protect their evidence. Nikiforov later died of a heart attack. "We are certain that he knew the truth," Grinberg said.(9) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the people of the Soviet Union and the outside world did not.<br><b>II. Night Watch for Nuclear War </b><br><br>The shift change began at 7 P.M. on September 26, 1983. Stanislav Petrov, a lieutenant colonel, arrived at Serpukhov-15, south of Moscow, a top-secret missile attack early-warning station, which received signals from satellites. Petrov changed from street clothes into the soft uniform of the military space troops of the Soviet Union. Over the next hour, he and a dozen other specialists asked questions of the outgoing officers. Then his men lined up two rows deep and reported for duty to Petrov. Their twelve-hour shift had begun.(10) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Petrov settled into a comfortable swivel chair with arms. His com�mand post overlooked the main floor of the early-warning station through a window. In front of him were telephones to connect to head�quarters and electronic monitors. Out on the floor, beyond the specialists and their consoles, a large map covered the far wall. At the center of the map was the North Pole. Above the pole and beyond it&#x2014;as it might be seen from space&#x2014;were Canada and the United States, inverted. Below the pole stretched the vast lands of the Soviet Union. This was the path that nuclear missiles would take if ever launched. The map showed the location of Minuteman missile bases in the United States. Petrov knew those bases held one thousand intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads that could cross the Arctic and reach the Soviet Union in thirty-five minutes. On the main floor, a dozen men monitored elec�tronic consoles with a singular mission: using satellites to spot a launch and give the leaders of the Soviet Union an added margin of ten minutes' warning, or maybe twelve minutes, to decide what to do. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Petrov, forty-four, had served in the military for twenty-six years, ris�ing to deputy chief of the department for combat algorithms. He was more of an engineer than a soldier. He liked the logic of writing formu�las, often using English-based computer languages. On most days, he was not in the commander's chair but at a desk in a nearby building, working as an analyst, responding to glitches, fine-tuning the software. But twice a month, he took an operations shift in order to keep on top of the system. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Petrov first arrived eleven years earlier, the station was new, with equipment still in crates and the rooms empty. Now, it had grown into a bristling electronic nerve ...</p></p><h2>Martha Stewart&#39;s Cookies: The Very Best Treats to Bake and to Share: A Baking Book</h2><p><b>175 cookie recipes and variations that showcase all kinds of flavors and fancies to make the perfect cookie for any occasion. </b><br><br>Cookies are the treat that never disappoint, whether you&#x2019;re baking for a party or a picnic, a formal dinner or a family supper, or if you simply want something on hand for snacking. <i>Martha Stewart's Cookies</i> feature recipes for perennial pleasers like traditional chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin, as well as other sweet surprises, including Rum Raisin Shortbread, Peppermint Meringue Sandwiches with Chocolate Filling, and Lime Meltaways. <br><br> Cleverly organized by texture, the recipes in <i>Martha Stewart&#x2019;s Cookies</i> inspire you to think of a classic, nostalgic treat with more nuance.

Author David Kessler has identified key areas of concern: the need to be treated as a living human being, the need for hope, the need to express emotions, the need to participate in care, the need for honesty, the need for spirituality, and the need to be free of physical pain. Examining the physical and emotional experiences of life-challenging illnesses, Kessler provides a vocabulary for family members and for the dying that allows them to communicate with doctors, with hospital staff, and with one another, and&#x2014;at a time when the right words are exceedingly difficult to find&#x2014;he helps readers find a way to say good-bye. Using comforting and touching stories, he provides information to help us meet the needs of a loved one at this important time in our lives.</p></p><p>Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, author of "On Death and Dying" <br>"It is now, fortunately, my time to face death.

Gardner spoke of an &#34;end-run around national sovereignty&#34;, a &#34;booming, buzzing confusion&#34; and building it from the &#34;bottom up&#34; rather than attempting an &#34;old-fashioned frontal assault.&#34; After almost 45 years, it is time to examine the record. In Technocracy: The Hard Road to World Order, Wood traces the steps and developments that led to the United Nations&#39; establishment of Sustainable Development as an outgrowth of historic Technocracy from the 1930s. UN programs such as 2030 Agenda, New Urban Agenda and the Paris Climate Agreement are all working together to displace Capitalism and Free Enterprise as the world&#39;s principal economic system. As a resource-based economic system, Sustainable Development intends to take control of all resources, all production and all consumption on planet earth, leaving all of its inhabitants to be micro-managed by a Scientific Dictatorship. Topics covered include the devolution of federal governments combined with the rise of global Smart Cities. Tools are examined, like ubiquitous surveillance, collaborative governance, Public-Private Partnerships, Reflexive Law, Fintech, including crypto currencies and the drive toward a cashless society. The spiritual aspect of Sustainable Development is also explored as an important component of manipulation. Looking underneath the cover of globalization, Wood shatters the false narrative of a promised Utopia and exposes the true nature of the deception used to promote this new economic order. Those elite who hate the bedrock of American liberty and its time-tested Constitution have pulled out all the stops to destroy both, and it&#39;s time for citizens to stand up to reject them. As always, Wood closes with the nature of effective resistance and the tools that can help to achieve success.</p><p></p><h2>American Journal: Fifty Poems for Our Time</h2><p><p><b>A landmark anthology envisioned by Tracy K.

Refashioning the story of human evolution, Wilson draws on his remarkable knowledge of biology and social behavior to demonstrate that group selection, not kin selection, is the premier driving force of human evolution. In a work that James D. Watson calls &#x201c;a monumental exploration of the biological origins of the human condition,&#x201d; Wilson explains how our innate drive to belong to a group is both a &#x201c;great blessing and a terrible curse&#x201d; (<em>Smithsonian</em>). Demonstrating that the sources of morality, religion, and the creative arts are fundamentally biological in nature, the renowned Harvard University biologist presents us with the clearest explanation ever produced as to the origin of the human condition and why it resulted in our domination of the Earth&#x2019;s biosphere. 90 illustrations</p><p>Edward O.

Good thing we have options! Most people assume that healthy or serious relationships which involve romance and sex are supposed to follow this path: from attraction and dating, through exclusivity and living together, to marriage that ideally lasts a lifetime. However, there are plenty of other great ways to do relationships. Options that don't involve lying, cheating, affairs, infidelity, avoiding dating or relationships, swearing off sex or love, or not being true to yourself or others. The &#x201c;Relationship Escalator&#x201d; is the traditional bundle of social norms for intimate relationships: monogamy, cohabitation and much more, ideally until death do you part. Beyond this, it might not be obvious what other options exist. WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK: This book is a fun, intriguing introduction to unusual relationship options. If you want to explore unconventional relationships, or simply to understand your options, you'll find guidance here. If you want to help people you know understand relationships that don't follow the norm, this is a friendly starting point. WHAT MAKES THIS BOOK WORTH READING: This isn't just one person's opinion. Journalist Amy Gahran surveyed 1500 people about their unconventional intimate relationships: how those relationships work and feel. They shared moving, in-depth personal stories and insights. More than 300 people are quoted in this nonfiction book. "Stepping Off the Relationship Escalator" showcases real-life experiences of: - Consensual nonmonogamy: Polyamory, swinging, open relationships or being monogamish. - Going solo: Choosing to live alone (or at least not with intimate partners), to not surrender individuality to couplehood, or to remain single by choice. - Avoiding hierarchy: Not prioritizing a particular adult relationship by default, simply because it includes sex/romance or started first. - Asexual and aromantic love, which emphasize forms of intimacy and bonding that our society often discounts. - Relationship anarchy: Where all aspects of a relationship are based on negotiation and consent. - Valuing relationships that often get discounted: Ones that don't feel very intense, continue without interruption, or last forever. Traditional relationships are a fine choice for many people. And: relationships are always a choice. Isn't it better to make important choices consciously, with awareness of options -- rather than by default? More information about this ongoing project, and future books in this series: OffEscalator.com</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I first became interested in writing about unconventional relationships decades ago, when I finally admitted to myself that I'm no good at doing relationships the "normal" way.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet, like most people, I still want -- and value -- having love, intimacy, commitment and mutual support in my life.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beating myself up for "not doing relationships right." didn't help. Eventually, it occurred to me: <b>Maybe there are <i>many</i> ways to do relationships right, not just one way.</b><b></b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And indeed, we do have many options for how love can work. Which ones might suit you best?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In my own life, this led me to explore polyamory (a form of consensual nonmonogamy), which works much better for me. As does solohood (not living with intimate partners). As a <i>solo poly </i>person, I've deepened the love, connection and commitment in all my important relationships -- including my relationship with myself.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn't easy for me to find these options in the mid 90s. Today, you have it much easier -- with Google, Facebook, online forums, podcasts, YouTube,&nbsp; Meetup.com, and online dating sites that welcome people who do relationships differently.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>The catch&nbsp;is: doing relationships differently can feel isolating and scary. </b>Most people don't know people who have, or wants, anything different than the <i>Relationship Escalator. </i>Or at least, they think they don't know anyone (who is mature, sane and respectable) who wants a different kind of relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But actually, most of us <i>do</i> know people in unusual relationships. Like most queer people did for centuries, they're hiding in the closet, worried about how others might judge and treat them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In recent years, the rights and visibility of people representing the diversity of gender and sexual orientation have advanced mightily. Nevertheless, widespread and&nbsp;strong stigma remains against relationships styles that diverge from social norms. For instance, if you don't want monogamy, or to live with a partner, or if you don't want sex and romance, people often wonder: <i>what's wrong with you?</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It can be hard to learn what your relationship options are, or imagine what they might look like or how they might feel or work, if examples aren't obvious in your life and community, or in the media.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>I wrote this book for a simple purpose:</b> We all have options for intimate relationships. Here's what they look like, through real experiences from real people. With this insight, anyone can make better choices, in any kind of relationship. Also, stigma tends to wither in the light of knowledge.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whether you prefer a traditional relationship<i>&nbsp;</i>or something else, I hope this book will encourage you to think more deeply about all of your relationships. Simply by understanding that there's more than one valid way to do relationships, you are helping to make the world a safer and friendlier place for all kinds of relationships.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Personally, I think this world can use all the love and connection it can get.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Enjoy!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Amy GahranLove is not one-size-fits-all.

Using the landmark 2008 case <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em>&#x2015;which invalidated a law banning handguns in the nation&#x2019;s capital&#x2015;as a springboard, Winkler brilliantly weaves together the dramatic stories of gun-rights advocates and gun-control lobbyists, providing often unexpected insights into the venomous debate that now cleaves our nation. 20 illustrations</p><p>Adam Winkler is a professor at UCLA School of Law, where he specializes in American constitutional law.

A cover-up. Secret tribunals, out-of-control intelligence agencies, and government corruption. Welcome to 1890s Paris.<br><b>&nbsp;</b></b><br>Alfred Dreyfus has been convicted of treason, sentenced to life imprisonment on a far-off island, and publicly stripped of his rank. Among the witnesses to his humiliation is Georges Picquart, an ambitious military officer who believes in Dreyfus's guilt as staunchly as any member of the public. But when he is promoted to head of the French counter-espionage agency, Picquart finds evidence that a spy still remains at large in the military&#x2014;indicating that Dreyfus is innocent. As evidence of the most malignant deceit mounts and spirals inexorably toward the uppermost levels of government, Picquart is compelled to question not only the case against Dreyfus but also his most deeply held beliefs about his country, and about himself.&nbsp;<br><br><b><b>Winner of the Walter Scott Prize for historical fiction<br></b>Winner of the American Library in Paris Book Award</b></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, February 2014:</strong> A spy thriller and psychological examination, Robert Harris&#x2019;s <em>An Officer and a Spy</em> looks at the infamous Dreyfus affair through the personage of a functionary-turned-whistle-blower. It&#x2019;s Paris, 1895. A Jewish army officer, Alfred Dreyfus, has been convicted of treason and is imprisoned on Devil&#x2019;s Island; he has been publicly humiliated, bound in chains, banished to solitary confinement. But was he really a spy for Germany--or was his fate sealed because he was a Jew in an anti-Semitic time and place? Slowly, the petit bureaucrat Georges Picquart begins to suspect that Dreyfus--portrayed here mostly through heart-wrenching real-life letters he wrote from prison to his beloved family--has been scapegoated. As Picquart amasses more and more evidence about Dreyfus, he also must come to terms with some of his own behaviors and attitudes. Still, for all its delicious detail about the mores of Belle Epoque Paris, both social and political, this novel is also one for the ages, or at least for the ages in which powerful intelligence agencies, government surveillance and cover-ups are worrisomely becoming the norm. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>Robert Harris is the author of eight bestselling novels:&nbsp;<i>Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, Imperium, The Ghost Writer, Conspirata,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Fear Index</i>.

One of his few writings, the booklet also includes many pictures of Blessed Padre Pio from throughout his ministry. Padre Pio's beautiful and descriptive manner of writing provide a wonderful spiritual insight into that last night of Jesus' human life.<br><br><b>Excerpt: </b><br><br><i>"Jesus has returned to His place of prayer, and another picture, more terrible than the first, presents itself to Him. All our sins with their entire ugliness parade before Him in every detail. He must clothe Himself with this entire unclean mass of human corruption and present Himself before the sanctity of His Father, to expiate everything with individual pains, to render Him all that glory of which they have robbed Him, to cleanse that human cesspool in which man wallows with contemptible indifference.</i><br><br><i>And all this does not make Him retreat. As a raging sea this mass inundates Him, enfolds Him, oppresses Him. Behold Him before His Father the God of Justice, facing the full penalty of divine justice. He, the essence of purity, sanctity by nature, in contact with sin, indeed, as if He Himself had become a sinner! Who can fathom the disgust that He feels in His innermost spirit? The horror He feels? The nausea, the contempt He senses so vividly? And having taken all upon Himself, nothing excepted, He is crushed by this immense weight, oppressed, thrown down, prostrated. Exhausted, He groans beneath the weight of Divine Justice, before His Father, Who has permitted His Son to offer Himself as a Victim for sin, as one accursed."</i></p><p>St. Pio of Pietrelcina was born as Francesco Forgione in 1877 at Pietrelcina, Italy. At the age of five he reportedly decided to dedicate his life to God, becoming a novice of the Capuchin Friars ten years afterward with the customary vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. He received Holy Orders in 1910, and subsequently served many of the faithful as a spiritual director. Though he suffered a great deal both spiritually and physically, he always remained firm in the confidence of Jesus, Mary, and his Guardian Angel. Padre Pio was also a famed Stigmatist, and died on the twenty-third of September, 1968. He was canonized by Pope John Paul II in 2002, and his feast is celebrated on the twenty-third of September.<br></p><h2>Prophetic Lament: A Call for Justice in Troubled Times</h2><p><ul><li>Missio Alliance Essential Reading List of 2015</li><li>Hearts Minds Bookstore's Best Books of 2015, Social Criticism and Cultural Engagement</li><li><em>RELEVANT's</em> Top 10 Books of 2015, Non-Fiction</li><li>Englewood Review of Books Best Books of 2015, Theology</li></ul> When Soong-Chan Rah planted an urban church in Cambridge, Massachusetts, his first full sermon series was a six-week exposition of the book of Lamentations. Preaching on an obscure, depressing Old Testament book was probably not the most seeker-sensitive way to launch a church. But it shaped their community with a radically countercultural perspective. The American church avoids lament. But lament is a missing, essential component of Christian faith. Lament recognizes struggles and suffering, that the world is not as it ought to be. Lament challenges the status quo and cries out for justice against existing injustices. Soong-Chan Rah's prophetic exposition of the book of Lamentations provides a biblical and theological lens for examining the church's relationship with a suffering world. It critiques our success-centered triumphalism and calls us to repent of our hubris. And it opens up new ways to encounter the other. Hear the prophet's lament as the necessary corrective for Christianity's future. A Resonate exposition of the book of Lamentations.</p><p>Soong-Chan Rah is Milton B. Engebretson Associate Professor of Church Growth and Evangelism at North Park Theological Seminary in Chicago. His books include <em>The Next Evangelicalism</em> and <em>Many Colors</em>.<br><br>Rev.

Derek McNeil and their two children."This book illuminates the resilient faith of a current lamenter's raw trust in God. Everyone engaged in the shared struggle to hope in the midst of a violent and unjust world ought to read this accessible integration of biblical text, witness and sharp insight into the present cultural realties of the American church. Readers will discover a pithy prophetic response to the reality of shame, the problem of privilege and the possibilities of honor, hope and worship with integrity. This volume is a credit to the Resonate series." (James K. Bruckner, professor of Old Testament, North Park Theological Seminary, author, Healthy Human Life)<br><br>"<em>Prophetic Lament</em> is a commentary on the Old Testament book of Lamentations. Rather than reading as a typical commentary with foci on individual verses, original languages, and such, the book reads as an extended essay that swerves consciously between the experience of Israel's exile and reflections on contemporary events, particularly issues of justice that have often escaped white churches. . . . "Lamentations is a book that can and should speak into our current circumstances and, in <em>Prophetic Lament</em>, Rah has given us an accessible introduction for our troubled times." (David Swanson, Signs of Life, December 19, 2015)<br><br>"Soong-Chan Rah adds a significant voice to the rich and growing interpretive corpus on the book of Lamentations. He brings to his study a special attentiveness to the rootage of lament in Korean religious tradition. As Western culture is increasingly in 'free fall,' there is compelling reason to pay steady attentiveness to Lamentations. Rah's book will be of great value in that now-required attentiveness." (Walter Brueggemann, Columbia Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Let me warn you ahead of time. This isn't a how-to, feel-good, seven-steps-to-cool-justice kind of book. In a culture today where we often elevate conversations about justice, reconciliation and peacemaking, Dr. Soong-Chan Rah provokes challenge and courage for the church not just to love the ideas of such things but to commit ourselves to the journey&#x2015;even at the cost of including the oft forgotten process of deep lament and confession. To say that I loved <em>Prophetic Lament</em> by Dr. Rah would be somewhat misleading. I didn't love the book, but I confess, I <em>needed</em> this book and believe this to be an important resource for the wider church." (Eugene Cho, senior pastor, Quest Church, author of Overrated)<br><br>"Not often am I taken by surprise when reading a book. As an academic and a writer, I've read a lot of books, and even though I've read the Bible many times over, I confess I had not really taken Lamentations or lament seriously until now. In <em>Prophetic Lament</em>, Rah gifts the church not only with his caring prophetic voice but also his pastoral calling, which help us to grieve the sins of our society and those of the church. This book is timely and reaches very deep theologically, emotionally and spiritually. If you care about our country and about how God feels about us, <em>Prophetic Lament</em> is not just a must-read; it is a must-read-now! Place this book on the top of your reading priority list." (Randy Woodley, Distinguished Professor of Faith and Culture, George Fox Seminary, author, Shalom and the Community of Creation)<br><br>"Soong-Chan Rah argues for reorienting Christian theology, ministry and church life around the harsh realities of our time. The anguished cries of those who endured the ransacking of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, which come to us in the book of Lamentations, have much to teach us. Repentance and shame, not triumphalism; compassion and justice, not consumerism; hope in a sovereign and faithful God, not despair&#x2015;these are what that ancient text and <em>Prophetic Lament</em> call us to embrace. A needed word!" (M. Daniel Carroll R., distinguished professor of Old Testament, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"As a product of the African-American and urban church I am grateful for this important resource on the mission of God in the context of suffering. Soong-Chan Rah's transparent, prophetic and practical voice comes through in powerful and deeply insightful ways on the pages. In a time when too many churches are held captive to a feel-good and happy-rich gospel, this book shows us a more authentic biblical narrative." (Efrem Smith, president and CEO of World Impact, author of The Post-Black and Post-White Church)<br><br>"Finally, a book that rightly commends lament as the best way to interpret and reckon with the pain and suffering so prominent in today's news! The book also gives Lamentations, an oft-overlooked biblical book, a voice&#x2015;a very fresh voice&#x2015;in that reckoning. The author's scholarship is first-rate, his style winsome and true-to-life, and his message occasionally hard-hitting but always hugely relevant. An important book for openhearted evangelicals." (Bob Hubbard, professor emeritus of biblical literature, North Park Theological Seminary)<br><br>"In modern American Christianity, especially in the white church, we have done a disservice to our faith, our relationship with God and ultimately the justice of our society by focusing on the triumphal Scriptures of praise and glossing over the equally essential Scriptures of lament. In Soong-Chan Rah's riveting and provocative commentary on the book of Lamentations, he shows us that there can be no authentic praise and joy without justice, and no true justice without the deep acknowledgement of injustice, pain and sin inherent in the biblical practice of lament. Soong-Chan Rah masterfully explains the meaning of Lamentations in the context in which it was written, then seamlessly applies the lessons of these Scriptures to our contemporary setting, raising a powerful and prophetic challenge to the American church on critical issues such as racial inequity. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to understand and embrace a fuller, more authentic and more just expression of Christianity. <em>Prophetic Lament</em> is more evidence of Soong-Chan Rah becoming one of the most important theologians of our time, and one of the few who truly understands the world into which theology must now enter." (Jim Wallis, New York Times bestselling author of The UnCommon Good, president of Sojourners, editor in chief of Sojourners magazine)<br><br>"This timely book is indeed prophetic in its call for us to live as the faithful and repentant people of God in our violent age."

Born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, hooks drew her unique pseudonym from the name of her grandmother, an intelligent and strong-willed African American woman who inspired her to stand up against a dominating and repressive society. Her poetry, novels, memoirs, and children's books reflect her Appalachian upbringing and feature her struggles with racially integrated schools and unwelcome authority figures. One of <i>Utne Reader</i>'s "100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life," hooks has won wide acclaim from critics and readers alike.<br><br>In <i>Appalachian Elegy</i>, bell hooks continues her work as an imagist of life's harsh realities in a collection of poems inspired by her childhood in the isolated hills and hidden hollows of Kentucky. At once meditative, confessional, and political, this poignant volume draws the reader deep into the experience of living in Appalachia. Touching on such topics as the marginalization of its people and the environmental degradation it has suffered over the years, hooks's poetry quietly elegizes the slow loss of an identity while also celebrating that which is constant, firmly rooted in a place that is no longer whole.</p><p><b>bell hooks</b> is the author of more than thirty books, including <i>Ain't I a Woman?

Here she radically reinvisions the history of Kentucky, lowering a plumb line of stark and insistent language into the depths of Appalachia.

Or, more accurately, my clothes were once again hanging in my former bedroom, but I was living out of a backpack in a trailer on the north end of Redmond&#x2019;s Trading Post &amp; Dinosaur World. That&#x2019;s where my father&#x2019;s captive wolf packs were housed, along with gibbons, falcons, an overweight lion, and the animatronic T. rex that roared on the hour. Since that was where my father spent 99 percent of his time, it was expected that I follow.<br> <br>I thought this alternative beat living with my mom and Joe and the miracle twins, but it hadn&#x2019;t been the smooth transition I&#x2019;d hoped for. I guess I&#x2019;d pictured my dad and me making pancakes together on Sunday morning, or playing hearts, or taking walks in the woods. Well, my dad did take walks in the woods, but they were inside the pens he&#x2019;d built for his packs, and he was busy being a wolf. He&#x2019;d roll around in the mud with Sibo and Sobagw, the numbers wolves; he&#x2019;d steer clear of Pekeda, the beta of the pack. He&#x2019;d eat from the carcass of a calf with wolves on either side of him, his hands and his mouth bloody. My dad believed that infiltrating a pack was far more educational than observing from afar the way biologists did. By the time I moved in with him, he&#x2019;d already gotten five packs to accept him as a bona fide member&#x2014;worthy of living with, eating with, and hunting with them, in spite of the fact that he was human. Because of this, some people thought he was a genius. The rest thought he was insane.<br> <br>On the day I left my mom and her brand-spanking-new family, my dad was not exactly waiting for me with open arms. He was down in one of the enclosures with Mestawe, who was pregnant for the first time, and he was trying to forge a relationship with her so she&#x2019;d pick him as the nanny for the pups. He even slept there, with his wolf family, while I stayed up late and flicked through the TV channels. It was lonely in the trailer, but it was lonelier being landlocked at an empty house.<br> <br>In the summers, the White Mountains region was packed with visitors who went from Santa&#x2019;s Village to Story Land to Redmond&#x2019;s Trading Post. In March, though, that stupid T. rex roared to an empty theme park. The only people who stayed on in the off-season were my dad, who looked after his wolves, and Walter, a caretaker who covered for my dad when he wasn&#x2019;t on-site. It felt like a ghost town, so I started hanging out at the enclosures after school&#x2014;close enough that Bedagi, the tester wolf, would pace on the other side of the fence, getting used to my scent. I&#x2019;d watch my father dig a birthing bowl for Mestawe in her den, and meanwhile, I&#x2019;d tell him about the football captain who was caught cheating, or the oboe player in the school orchestra who had taken to wearing caftans, and was rumored to be pregnant.<br> <br>In return, my dad told me why he was worried about Mestawe: she was a young female, and instinct only went so far. She didn&#x2019;t have a role model who could teach her to be a good mother; she&#x2019;d never had a litter before. Sometimes, a wolf would abandon her pups simply because she didn&#x2019;t know better.<br> <br>The night Mestawe gave birth, she seemed to be doing everything by the book. My father celebrated by opening a bottle of champagne and letting me drink a glass. I wanted to see the babies, but my father said it would be weeks before they emerged. Even Mestawe would stay in the den for a full week, feeding the pups every two hours.<br> <br>Only two nights later, though, my father shook me awake. &#x201c;Cara,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I need your help.&#x201d;<br> <br>I threw on my winter coat and boots and followed him to the enclosure where Mestawe was in her den. Except, she wasn&#x2019;t. She was wandering around, as far from her babies as she could get. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tried everything to get her back inside, but she won&#x2019;t go,&#x201d; my father said matter-of-factly. &#x201c;If we don&#x2019;t save the pups now, we won&#x2019;t have a second chance.&#x201d;<br> <br>He burrowed into the den and came out holding two tiny, wrinkled rats. At least that&#x2019;s what they looked like, eyes squinched shut, wriggling in his hand. He passed these over to me; I tucked them inside my coat as he pulled out the last two pups. One looked worse off than the other three. It wasn&#x2019;t moving; instead of grunting, it let out tiny puffs every now and then.<br> <br>I followed my dad to a toolshed that stood behind the trailer. While I was sleeping he&#x2019;d tossed all the tools into the snow; now the floor inside was covered with hay. A blanket I recognized from the trailer&#x2014;a fluffy red plaid&#x2014;was inside a small cardboard box. &#x201c;Tuck them in,&#x201d; my father instructed, and I did. A hot water bottle underneath the blanket made it feel warm like a belly; three of the babies immediately began to snuffle between the folds. The fourth pup was cold to the touch. Instead of putting her beside her brothers, I slipped her into my coat again, against my heart.<br> <br>When my father returned, he was holding baby bottles full of Esbilac, which is like formula, but for animals. He reached for the little wolf in my arms, but I couldn&#x2019;t let her go. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll feed the others,&#x201d; he told me, and while I coaxed mine to drink a drop at a time, his three sucked down every last bottle.<br> <br>Every two hours, we fed the babies. The next morning, I didn&#x2019;t get dressed for school and my father didn&#x2019;t act like he expected me to. It was an unspoken truth: what we were doing here was far more important than anything I could learn in a classroom.<br> <br>On the third day, we named them. My father believed in using indigenous names for indigenous creatures, so all his wolf names came from the Abenaki language. Nodah, which meant Hear me, was the name we gave the biggest of the bunch, a noisy black ball of energy. Kina, or Look here, was the troublemaker who got tangled in shoelaces or stuck under the flaps of the cardboard box. And Kita, or Listen, hung back and watched us, his eyes never missing a thing.<br> <br>Their little sister I named Miguen, Feather. There were times she&#x2019;d drink as well as her brothers and I would believe she was out of the woods, but then she&#x2019;d go limp in my grasp and I&#x2019;d have to rub her and slip her inside my shirt to keep her warm again.<br> <br>I was so tired from staying up round the clock that I couldn&#x2019;t see straight. I sometimes slept on my feet, dozing for a few minutes before I snapped awake again. The whole time, I carried Miguen, until my arms felt empty without her in them. On the fourth night, when I opened my eyes after nodding off, my father was staring at me with an expression I&#x2019;d never seen before on his face. &#x201c;When you were born,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t let go of you, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>Two hours later, Miguen started shaking uncontrollably. I begged my father to drive to a vet, to the hospital, to someone who could help. I cried so hard that he bundled the other pups into a box and carried them out to the battered truck he drove. The box sat between us in the front seat and Miguen shivered beneath my coat. I was shaking, too, although I&#x2019;m not sure whether I was cold, or just afraid of what I knew was coming.<br> <br>She was gone by the time we got to the parking lot of the vet&#x2019;s office. I knew the minute it happened; she grew lighter in my arms. Like a shell.<br> <br>I started to scream. I couldn&#x2019;t stand the thought of Miguen, dead, being this close to me.<br> <br>My father took her away and wrapped her in his flannel shirt. He slipped the body into the backseat, where I wouldn&#x2019;t have to see her. &#x201c;In the wild,&#x201d; he told me, &#x201c;she never would have lasted a day. You&#x2019;re the only reason she stayed as long as she did.&#x201d;<br> <br>If that was supposed to make me feel better, it didn&#x2019;t. I burst into loud sobs.<br> <br>Suddenly the box with the wolf pups was on the dashboard, and I was in my father&#x2019;s arms. He smelled of spearmint and snow. For the first time in my life, I understood why he couldn&#x2019;t break free from the drug that was the wolf community. Compared to issues like this, of life and death, did it really matter if the dry cleaning was picked up, or if he forgot the date of open-school night?<br> <br>In the wild, my father told me, a mother wolf learns her lessons the hard way. But in captivity, where wolves are bred only once every three or four years, the rules are different. You can&#x2019;t stand by and just let a pup die. &#x201c;Nature knows what it wants,&#x201d; my father said. &#x201c;But that doesn&#x2019;t make it any easier for the rest of us, does it?&#x201d;<br> <br>There is a tree outside my father&#x2019;s trailer at Redmond&#x2019;s, a red maple. We planted it the summer after Miguen died, to mark the spot where she is buried. It&#x2019;s the same type of tree that, four years later, I see rushing toward the windshield too fast. The same type of tree our truck hits, in that instant, head-on.<br> <br>� � � <br> <br>A woman is kneeling beside me. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s awake,&#x201d; the woman says. There&#x2019;s rain in my eyes and I smell smoke and I can&#x2019;t see my father.<br> <br>Dad? I say, but I can only hear it in my head.<br> <br>My heart&#x2019;s beating in the wrong place. I look down at my shoulder, where I can feel it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Looks like a scapula fracture and maybe some broken ribs. Cara? Are you Cara?&#x201d;<br> <br>How does she know my name?<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been in an accident,&#x201d; the woman tells me. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to take you to the hospital.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My . . . father . . . ,&#x201d; I force out. Every word is a knife in my arm.<br> <br>I turn my head to try to find him and see the firemen, spraying a hose at the ball of flames that used to be my dad&#x2019;s truck. The rain on my face isn&#x2019;t rain, just mist from the stream of water.<br> <br>Suddenly I remember: the web of shattered windshield; the fishtail of the truck skidding; the smell of gasoline. The way when I cried for my dad he didn&#x2019;t answer. I start shaking all over.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re incredibly brave,&#x201d; the woman says to me. &#x201c;Dragging your father out of the car in your condition . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I saw an interview once where a teenage girl lifted a refrigerator off her little cousin when it accidentally fell on him. It had something to do with adrenaline.<br> <br>A fireman who has been blocking my view moves and I can see another knot of EMTs gathered around my father, who lies very still on the ground.<br> <br>&#x201c;If it weren&#x2019;t for you,&#x201d; the woman adds, &#x201c;your dad might not be alive.&#x201d;<br> <br>Later, I will wonder if that comment is the reason I did everything I did. But right now, I just start to cry. Because I know her words couldn&#x2019;t be farther from the truth.</p><h2>The Temple of the Golden Pavilion</h2><p>Because of the boyhood trauma of seeing his mother make love to another man in the presence of his dying father, Mizoguchi becomes a hopeless stutterer.

And while mastery of the classical language may not be a prerequisite for tending perennials, all gardeners stand to benefit from learning a bit of Latin and its conventions in the field. Without it, they might buy a <i>Hellebores foetidus </i>and be unprepared for its fetid smell, or a <i>Potentilla reptans </i>with the expectation that it will stand straight as a sentinel rather than creep along the ground.<br><br>An essential addition to the gardener&#x2019;s library, this colorful, fully illustrated book details the history of naming plants, provides an overview of Latin naming conventions, and offers guidelines for pronunciation. Readers will learn to identify Latin terms that indicate the provenance of a given plant and provide clues to its color, shape, fragrance, taste, behavior, functions, and more.&nbsp;</p>Full of expert instruction and practical guidance, <i>Latin for Gardeners</i> will allow novices and green thumbs alike to better appreciate the seemingly esoteric names behind the plants they work with, and to expertly converse with fellow enthusiasts.&nbsp;Soon they will realize that having a basic understanding of Latin before trips to the nursery or botanic garden is like possessing some knowledge of French before traveling to Paris; it enriches the whole experience.</p><p><p><b>Lorraine Harrison </b>is the author of several books, including <i>Inspiring Sussex Gardeners</i>, <i>The Shaker Book of the Garden</i>, <i>How to Read Gardens</i>, and <i>A Potted History of Vegetables: A Kitchen Cornucopia</i>.</p>"For those who want a better understanding of plant taxonomy,&nbsp;<i>Latin for Gardeners,</i>&nbsp;by Lorraine Harrison, is a treasure."

(<i>Martha Stewart Living</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Latin for Gardeners</i> is useful, surprising, and beautiful&#x2014;an accessible dictionary for everyone who puzzles over botanical identifications, an opportunity to get better acquainted with the extraordinary discoverers and namers of so many of our favorite plants, and a treat for all who enjoy the art and lore of the garden.&#x201d;<br> (Jane S. Smith, author of The Garden of Invention)<br><br>"I have several books dedicated to Latin plant names but none fall into the category of Lorraine Harrison&#x2019;s book which is not only informative but entertaining and beautifully illustrated.

In their beautiful house, they cook dinner together, they laugh together, and they dance together.<i> But some of the other families don?t accept them. They say they are different. How can a family have two moms and no dad? But Marmee and Meema?s house is full of love. And they teach their children that different doesn?t mean wrong.

The narrator, a black girl, describes how her two Caucasian mothers, Marmee and Meema, adopted her, her Asian brother, and her red-headed sister. She tells about the wonderful times they have growing up in Berkeley, CA. With their large extended family and friends, they celebrate Halloween with homemade costumes, build a tree house, organize a neighborhood block party, and host a mother-daughter tea party. The narrator continually reinforces the affectionate feelings among her mothers and siblings, and the illustrations depict numerous scenes of smiling people having a grand time. Most of the neighbors are supportive, except for one woman who tells Marmee and Meema, "I don't appreciate what you two are." Eventually, the children grow up, marry heterosexual spouses, and return home to visit their aged parents with their own children. Is this an idealized vision of a how a gay couple can be accepted by their family and community? Absolutely. But the story serves as a model of inclusiveness for children who have same-sex parents, as well as for children who may have questions about a "different" family in their neighborhood. A lovely book that can help youngsters better understand their world.&#x2014;<i>Martha Simpson, Stratford Library Association, CT</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From out of the south, like a dark insect crawling over a wrinkled blue tablecloth, a tired old cargo ship pushed her way through the Caribbean swells toward the entrance of Santiago Harbor on the isle of Cuba. The exhaust from her single funnel drifted in a blue haze under an easterly breeze as the sun settled below the western horizon and became a ponderous orange ball magnified by the earth's atmosphere.<br>She was one of the last tramp steamers, a cargo ship that traveled the sea anonymously to the exotic and far-flung ports of the world. There were few left in operation. They did not follow a regular shipping route. Their schedules depended on the demands of their cargo and its owners, so their destinations changed from port to port. They coasted in, unloaded their freight and sailed away like wraiths in the night.<br>Two miles from shore, a small boat slapped over the rolling sea, approached the ship and swung around on a parallel course. The pilot closed on the rust-streaked hull as a boarding ladder was thrown down from an open hatch.<br>The pilot, a man in his fifties with brown skin and thick gray hair, stared up at the ancient ship. Her black paint was faded and badly needed to be chipped away and repainted. Streams of rust flowed from every opening in the hull. The huge anchor, pulled tightly in its hawsehole, was completely covered by corrosion. The pilot read the letters, barely discernible on the upper bow. The weary old freighter was named Oregon.<br>Jesus Morales shook his head in amazement. It was a miracle the ship hadn't been scrapped twenty years ago, he mused. She looked more like a derelict than a cargo carrier still in service. He wondered if the party bureaucrats in the Ministry of Transportation had any idea of the condition of the ship they had contracted to bring in a cargo of chemical fertilizer for the sugar and tobacco fields. He could not believe the ship had passed maritime insurance inspection.<br>As the ship slowed almost to a dead stop, Morales stood at the railing and the pilot boat's bumpers squeezed against the freighter's hull. Timing the crest of a wave as it lifted the boat, Morales leaped agilely from the wet deck onto the boarding ladder and climbed to the hatch. It was a function he performed as often as ten times a day. A pair of crewmen were waiting beside the hatch and helped him up on the deck. The two were both burly-looking individuals, and they did not bother to smile in greeting. One simply pointed toward the ladder leading to the bridge. Then they turned and left Morales standing alone on the deck. Watching them walk away, Morales hoped that he'd never have to meet them in a dark alley.<br>He paused before climbing the ladder and took a few moments to study the upper works of the ship.<br>From his long experience and knowledge of ships, he judged her length at 560 feet, with a 75-foot beam. Probably a gross tonnage around 11,000. Five derricks, two behind the funnel and superstructure and three on the forward deck, stood waiting to unload her cargo. He counted six holds with twelve hatches. In her prime, she would have been classed as an express cargo liner. He guessed that she had been built and launched in the early 1960s. The flag on her stern was Iranian. Not a registry Morales had seen very often.<br>If the Oregon looked shabby from the waterline, she looked downright squalid from her main deck. Rust covered every piece of deck machinery from winches to chains, but the hardware at least appeared to be in usable condition. By comparison, the derricks looked as if they hadn't been operated in years.<br>To add further insult, battered drums, tools and what could only be described as junked equipment were scattered around the decks. In all his years as a harbor pilot, Morales had never seen a ship in such filthy condition.<br>He climbed the ladder steps leading to the bridge, past bulkheads with flaking paint and portholes whose lenses were cracked and yellowed. Then he paused before finally swinging the door open. The interior of the vessel was as bad, if not worse. The wheelhouse was dirty, with the scars of cigarette burns on the counters and on what had once been a polished teak deck. Dead flies littered the windowsills, the smell assaulted his nose. And then there was the captain.<br>Morales was greeted by a great slob of a man with an immense stomach that sagged over his belt line. The face was scarred, and the nose so badly broken it slanted toward the left cheek. The thick black hair was plastered back with some kind of greasy cream and his beard was scruffy and stringy. The captain was a cacophony of colors. His eyes were red and his teeth yellow-brown, while his arms were covered with blue tattoos. A grimy yachtsman's cap sat perched on the back of his head and he wore dingy coveralls. The tropical heat and the humidity on the non-air-conditioned bridge made it obvious to Morales that the man had not bathed for at least a month. Any dog worth his salt would have tried to bury the man.<br>He extended a sweaty hand to Morales and spoke in English. &#x201c;Glad to see you. I'm Captain Jed Smith.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jesus Morales. Pilot for the Harbor Office of Santiago.&#x201d; Morales felt uncomfortable. Smith spoke English with an American accent--not what he'd expected on a ship of Iranian registry.<br>Smith handed him a packet of papers. &#x201c;Here's our registration and cargo manifest.&#x201d;<br>Morales merely cast a brief glance at the documents. Officials on the docks would study them more closely. His only concern was that the ship had permission to enter the port. He handed back the packet and said, &#x201c;Shall we proceed?&#x201d;<br>Smith waved a hand toward a wooden helm that somehow seemed terribly old-fashioned for a ship built in the sixties. &#x201c;She's all yours, Senor Morales. What dock do you want us to moor at?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There are no docks available until Thursday. You will have to anchor in the middle of the harbor until then.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That's four days from now. We have a schedule to meet. We can't sit around for four days waiting to unload our cargo.&#x201d;<br>Morales shrugged. &#x201c;I have no control over the harbormaster. Besides, the docks are full with ships unloading new farm machinery and automobiles, now that the embargo has been lifted. These have priority over your cargo.&#x201d;<br>Smith threw up his hands. &#x201c;All right. I guess it's not the first time we had to twiddle our thumbs waiting to unload.&#x201d; He gave a broad, rotten-toothed grin. &#x201c;I guess me and my crew will just have to come ashore and make friends with your Cuban women.&#x201d;<br>The thought made Morales's skin crawl. Without further conversation, he stepped over to the helm as Smith called the engine room and ordered half speed. The pilot felt the engine's vibrations through the deck as the tired old ship began to make way again, and he aimed her bow toward the narrow entrance of Santiago Harbor, which was bordered by high bluffs that rose from the sea.<br>From offshore, the channel that led inside to the bellows-shaped harbor was invisible until a ship was nearly on top of it. Rising two hundred feet atop the cliffs on the right stood the old colonial fortress known as Morro Castle.<br>Morales noticed that Smith and the members of his mangy crew standing on the bridge seemed interested in the defenses that had been dug into the hillside when Fidel Castro had thought the United States was going to attack Cuba. They studied the gun and missile emplacements through expensive binoculars.<br>Morales smiled to himself. Let them look all they wanted most of the defenses were deserted. Only two small fortresses maintained a small company of soldiers to man the missile emplacements in the unlikely event an unwelcome vessel tried to enter the harbor.<br>Morales threaded his way through the buoys and steered the Oregon deftly around the twists and turns of the channel, which soon opened into the broad, ball-shaped harbor surrounded by the city of Santiago. The wheel felt strange to him, though. The odd feeling was barely perceptible, but there nonetheless. Whenever he turned the wheel, there seemed to be a short lag before the rudder responded. He made a quick but very slight turn to starboard before bringing the wheel back to port. It was definitely there, almost like an echo, a two-second delay. He did not sense sluggishness from the steering machinery, but rather a pause. It had to come from another origin. Yet when the response came, it was quick and firm. But why the hesitation?<br>&#x201c;Your helm has an off feel to it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Smith grunted. &#x201c;It's been that way for a few days. Next port we enter with a shipyard, I'll have the spindles on the rudder looked at.&#x201d;<br>It still made no sense to Morales, but the ship was entering the open part of the bay off the city now, and he pushed the mystery from his mind. He called the harbor officials over the ship's radio and kept them informed of his progress, and was given orders for the anchorage.<br>Morales pointed out the buoys to Smith that marked the mooring area and ordered the ship brought to slow speed. He then swung the stern around until the bow was facing the incoming tide before ordering all stop. The Oregon slowed to a halt in an open area between a Canadian container ship and a Libyan oil tanker.<br>&#x201c;You may drop your anchor,&#x201d; he said to Smith, who acknowledged with a nod as he held a loudspeaker in front of his face.<br>&#x201c;Let go anchor!&#x201d; he shouted at his crew. The command was answered a few seconds later by the rattling clatter of the chain links against the hawsehole, followed by a great splash as the anchor plunged into the water. The bow of the ship became hazy from the cloud of dust and rust that burst from the chain locker.<br>Morales released his grip on the worn spokes of the wheel and turned to Smith. &#x201c;You will, of course, pay the pilot's fee when you turn over your documents to the harbor officials.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why wait?&#x201d; snorted Smith. He reached into a pocket of his coveralls and produced a wad of crinkled American hundred-dollar bills. He counted out fifteen bills, then hesitated, looked into Morales's shocked expression, and said, &#x201c;Oh, what the heck, suppose we make it an even two thousand dollars.&#x201d;<br>Without the least indecision, Morales took the bills and slipped them into his wallet.<br>&#x201c;You are most generous, Captain Smith. I will notify the officials that the pilot's fee was paid in full.&#x201d;<br>Smith signed the required affidavits and logged the mooring. He put a massive arm around the Cuban's shoulder. &#x201c;Now about them girls. Where's a good place in Santiago to meet them?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The cabarets on the waterfront are where you'll find both cheap entertainment and drinks.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I'll tell my crew.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good-bye, Captain.&#x201d; Morales did not extend his hand. He already felt unclean just by being on board the ship; he could not bring himself to grip the greasy hand of the obnoxious captain. Morales's easygoing Cuban warmth had been cooled by the surroundings and he didn't want to waste another second on board the Oregon. Leaving the wheelhouse, he dropped down the ladder to the deck and descended to the waiting pilot boat, still stunned at experiencing the filthiest ship he had ever piloted into the harbor. Which is just what the owners of the Oregon wanted him to think.<br>If Morales had examined the ship more closely, he might have realized it was all a facade. The Oregon rode low in the water because of specially fitted ballast tanks, which when filled with water lowered the hull to make it look as though it were loaded with cargo. Even the engine tremors were mechanically staged. The ship's engines were whisper-silent and vibrationless.<br>And the coating of rust throughout the ship? It was artistically applied paint.<br>SATISFIED THAT THE pilot and his boat had pulled away from the Oregon, Captain Smith stepped over to a handrail mounted on the deck that did not seem to serve any particular purpose. He gripped it and pressed a button on the underside. The square section of the deck on which Smith was standing suddenly began descending until it stopped in a vast, brightly lit room filled with computers, automated controls and several large consoles containing communications and weapons-firing systems. The deck in the command center was richly carpeted, the walls were paneled in exotic woods and the furniture looked as if it had come straight from a designer's showroom. This room was the real heart of the Oregon.<br>The six people four men and two women neatly dressed in shorts, flowered shirts and white blouses were busy manning the various systems. One woman was scanning an array of TV monitors that covered every section of Santiago Bay, while a man zoomed a camera on the pilot boat as it turned and headed into the main channel. No one bothered to give the fat captain half a glance. Only a man dressed in khaki shorts and a green golf shirt approached him.<br>&#x201c;All go well with the pilot?&#x201d; asked Max Hanley, the ship's corporate president, who directed all operational systems, including the ship's engines.<br>&#x201c;The pilot noticed the delay in the helm.&#x201d;<br>Hanley grinned. &#x201c;If only he'd known he was steering a dead wheel. We'll have to make some adjustments, though. You speak to him in Spanish?&#x201d;<br>Smith smiled. &#x201c;My best Yankee English. Why let him know I speak his language? That way, I could tell if he played any tricks over the radio with the harbor officials as we anchored.&#x201d; Smith pulled back a sleeve of his grimy coveralls and checked a Timex watch with a badly scratched lens. &#x201c;Thirty minutes until dark.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The equipment in the moon pool is all ready.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And the landing crew?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Standing by.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I just have time to get rid of these smelly clothes and get decent,&#x201d; said Cabrillo, heading toward his cabin down a hallway hung with paintings by modern artists.<br>The crew cabins were concealed inside two of the cargo holds and were as plush as rooms in a five-star hotel. There was no separation between officers and crew on the Oregon. All were educated people, highly trained in their respective fields elite men and women who had served in the armed forces. The ship was owned by its staff, who were stockholders. There were no ranks. Cabrillo was chairman; Hanley, president; the others held various other titles. They were all mercenaries, here to make a profit though that did not necessarily rule out good works at the same time hired by countries or large companies to perform clandestine services around the world, very often at great risk.<br>THE MAN WHO left the cabin twenty minutes later did not look like the man who'd entered. The greasy hairpiece, scruffy beard and grimy coveralls were gone, as was the foul smell. So was the Timex, now replaced with a stainless-steel Concord chronograph. In addition, the man had dropped at least a hundred pounds.<br>Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo had transformed himself from the grimy sea dog Smith to his true self again. A tall man in his forties, ruggedly handsome, he stared through pixie-blue eyes. His blond hair was trimmed in a crew cut and a western cowboy-style mustache sprouted from his upper lip.<br>He hurried down the corridor to a far door and entered a control room perched high inside a vast cavern in the hull amidships. The three-deck-high moon pool, as it was called, was where all the Oregon&#x2019;s underwater equipment was stored diving gear; submersibles, manned and unmanned; and an array of underwater electronic sensors. A pair of state-of-the-art contemporary underwater craft by U.S. Submarines a sixty-five-foot Nomad 1000 and a thirty-two-foot Discovery 1000 hung in cradles. The doors on the bottom of the hull slid open and water flooded in until it was level with the outer waterline.<br>The remarkable ship was not what she appeared from her exterior. The outer decks and hull were disguised to make her look like a rust bucket.

Baltzer, James Hickey, Andrea Cole, Jan Bloom, and Deirdre Fay.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Attachment Disturbances in Adults&nbsp;</em>is a landmark resource for (1) understanding attachment, its development, and the most clinically relevant findings from attachment research, and (2) using this understanding to inform systematic, comprehensive, and clinically effective and efficient treatment of attachment disturbances in adults.&nbsp;</p><p>It offers an innovative therapeutic model and set of methods for treating adult patients with dismissing, anxious-preoccupied, or disorganized attachment. In rich detail, it integrates historical and leading-edge attachment research into practical, effective treatment protocols for each type of insecure attachment. Case transcripts and many sample therapist phrasings illustrate how to apply the methods in practice.</p><p>Part I, "Foundational Concepts," features a comprehensive overview of the field of attachment, including its history, seminal ideas, and existing knowledge about the development of attachment bonds and behaviors.</p><p>Part II, "Assessment," addresses the assessment of attachment disturbances. It includes an overview of attachment assessment for the clinician and a trove of practical recommendations for assessing patients' attachment behavior and status both outside of and within the therapeutic relationship.</p><p>In Part III, "Treatment," the authors not only review existing treatment approaches for attachment disorders in adults, but also introduce an unprecedented, powerful new treatment method. This method, the "Three Pillars" model, is built on three essential clinical ingredients:</p><ol><li>Systematically utilizing ideal parent figure imagery to develop a new positive, stable internal working model of secure attachment</li><li>Fostering a range of metacognitive skills</li><li>Fostering nonverbal and verbal collaborative behavior in treatment</li></ol><p>Used together, these interdependent pillars form a unified and profoundly effective method of treatment for attachment disturbances in adults&#x2015;a must for any clinician.</p><p>In Part IV, "Type-Specific Treatment," readers will learn specific variations of the three treatment pillars to maximize efficacy with each type of insecure attachment.</p><p>Finally, Part V, "A Treatment Guide and Expected Outcomes," describes treatment in a step-by-step format and provides a success-assessment guide for the Three Pillars approach.</p><p>This book is a comprehensive educational resource and a deeply practical clinical guide. It offers clinicians a complete set of tools for effective and efficient treatment of adult patients with attachment disturbances.</p></p><p><b> Daniel Brown, PhD</b>, is&nbsp;Associate Clinical Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School, where he teaches courses on performance excellence for health professionals and judges.

Unfortunately, cool &#x201c;kicks&#x201d; are often synonymous with wincing in agony. Which was the case a few months ago when I became madly infatuated with a pair of black,knee-high, leather boots while shopping in Chicago.When I tried them on and pranced around in a circle to impress my friends Kim and Sharon, they both looked dubious. Kim even asked, &#x201c;Are you sure they&#x2019;re comfortable? Because you look like you&#x2019;re walking funny.&#x201d;<br>I replied flippantly, &#x201c;Yeah, they&#x2019;re comfortable. And aren&#x2019;t they the most gorgeous boots you&#x2019;ve ever seen?&#x201d; while intentionally taking slower steps so as not to teeter in front of them anymore.<br>Of course, they weren&#x2019;t comfortable at all. I should&#x2019;ve done the smart thing and put those boots back into the box they came from. I should&#x2019;ve told the solicitous Nordstrom clerk, &#x201c;No thank you,&#x201d; and walked out of the store empty-handed. But I&#x2019;m more of an impulse shopper than an intelligent consumer, especially when it comes to shoes. So I surrendered the Visa and assured myself, <i>They&#x2019;re just a little stiff because they&#x2019;re made of such high-quality Italian leather. It won&#x2019;t take long for them to get broken in, and then they&#x2019;ll be as comfortable as a pair of slippers.<br></i>I foolishly decided to break them in that very night at a business event because they complemented the outfit I was wearing. I was convinced the cuteness factor far outweighed the possibility of discomfort.<br><i>Besides, </i>I reasoned, <i>a little pinch is nothing compared to how hip these boots will make me look.<br></i>Less than an hour later I was hobbling around like a geisha. And by the time the emcee introduced me, I no longer had any sensation in my toes. I limped mincingly to the podium and tried to focus on speaking while fearing my feet were in the initial stages of gangrene. All the while, my friends sat on the front row wearing &#x201c;I told you so&#x201d; expressions. Afterward they teased that I should&#x2019;ve explained the new-shoe shuffle to the audience. They mused that some people might have wondered if I&#x2019;d been boozing it up beforehand since I couldn&#x2019;t walk right all night!<br>Walking right is the theme of Psalm 1. This first song in the Psalter emphasizes how we must follow our heavenly Father&#x2019;s path instead of being lured off course by what ungodly people proclaim to be fashionable. And this ode to obedience includes a warning as well: attempting to be hip in ways that aren&#x2019;t cool with God will ultimately lead to hobbling around in pain, separated from the only One who loves you unconditionally.<br><b>&#x201c;JOY&#x201d; THIEVES<br></b>I can&#x2019;t help but grin over the fact that the book of Psalms begins with the word <i>happy. </i>And I find it especially intriguing that the happiness in Psalm 1 isn&#x2019;t associated with eating dark chocolate or finding a pair of designer shoes on the clearance rack. <br><br>Instead this literary smiley face refers to the profound joy and satisfaction that accompany walking closely with God:1<br><br>Happy are those who don&#x2019;t listen to the wicked,<br>who don&#x2019;t go where sinners go,<br>who don&#x2019;t do what evil people do. <i>Psalm 1:1, NCV<br></i>One Sunday when I was in junior high school, I was sitting in church beside a cute lothario named Gary. You can imagine how I felt when this suave young man, who was five years older than I and the object of a huge crush on my part, put his arm around my shoulders. We were sitting a few pews in front of Dad, and although Gary&#x2019;s attention was so titillating I couldn&#x2019;t pay attention to the sermon, I could sense Dad&#x2019;s disapproval wafting through the sanctuary. When the service was over, my normally softspoken father pulled me aside and declared, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better never catch you swapping slobber with that boy.&#x201d; Then he tersely told me to get in the car.<br>We drove home in uncomfortable silence, my dad staring straight ahead and me staring out the window thinking, <i>I hope none of my friends heard Dad. I can&#x2019;t believe he actually said &#x201c;slobber&#x201d;! Ugh, I wish he wasn&#x2019;t such a fuddy-duddy.<br></i>After we had pulled into the driveway and I had started walking toward the house, Dad finally broke the silence by saying, &#x201c;Lisa, come over here for a minute.&#x201d; He motioned for me to join him by the picnic table. I approached with a cautious &#x201c;Yes sir,&#x201d; and he said, &#x201c;I want you to get up on the table.&#x201d; I thought, <i>Oh man, Dad&#x2019;s losing it! </i>But he looked so serious that I obediently climbed on top of the picnic table.<br>Then he held up his arms and said, &#x201c;Take hold of my hands. Now when I say go, I want you to try to pull me up while I try to pull you off.&#x201d;<br>Of course, the minute he said go and pulled, I had to jump down because I couldn&#x2019;t keep my balance. Dad smiled&#x2014;sort of sadly&#x2014;and patted the bench beside him. When I sat down, he said, &#x201c;Honey, you need to realize that it&#x2019;s almost impossible to raise someone else up to your standards. If you choose to be with people who have lower morals, nine times out of ten they&#x2019;ll pull you down to their level.&#x201d;<br>It wasn&#x2019;t until a year or two later, after Gary had thoroughly rebelled against his Christian upbringing and gotten a young girl pregnant, that Dad&#x2019;s backyard object lesson really hit home. I realized he wasn&#x2019;t being a fuddy-duddy when he warned me about sharing spit with the community Casanova; he was protecting me. Dad knew what my adolescent heart had yet to learn: bad company is as corrosive as battery acid. Lounging around with unrepentant rebels is a sure way to lose your joy.<br>Which is the bottom line of the beginning of Psalm 1: happiness can&#x2019;t keep company with wickedness.<br><b>ABBA&#x2019;S ARBORETUM<br><br></b>My first tour of Israel ranks way up there on the &#x201c;a few of my favorite things&#x201d; list. The Mount of Beatitudes left me speechless. The Wailing Wall left me in tears. And the Garden Tomb left me giddy with gratitude. But the parched terrain of the Promised Land initially left me puzzled. I guess I&#x2019;d always imagined Israel as a lush green landscape dotted with fluffy white sheep and bearded guys playing harps under big shade trees (largely due to the influence of flannel-graph lessons in Vacation Bible School). It took a few days after landing at the Tel Aviv airport for me to get used to the wind-swept panorama of thornbushes, rocks, and scruffy little acacia trees. As if I were using an Etch A Sketch, I had to shake the image of a<br>garden from my mind and twist the dials to redraw Israel as a desert.<br>The reality of Israel&#x2019;s arid topography is what makes the lush imagery in the next two verses so striking.<br>They love the LORD&#x2019;s teachings,<br>and they think about those teachings day and night.<br>They are strong, like a tree planted by a river.<br>The tree produces fruit in season,<br>and its leaves don&#x2019;t die.<br>Everything they do will succeed. <i>Psalm 1:2&#x2013;3, NCV<br></i>It&#x2019;s unlikely this psalmist had ever seen a big tree unless it had been <i>transplanted, </i>which is a more accurate translation of the word &#x201c;planted&#x201d; in verse 3.4 As a matter of fact, quality lumber was such a scarcity in Israel (except for olive trees, which are more valuable for their oil than their timber) that Solomon actually had to arrange for cedar beams to be floated in from Lebanon when they were building the temple in Jerusalem.5<br>That&#x2019;s why this arbor metaphor is an unmistakable reference to <i>God&#x2019;s blessing; </i>only He could make a tree grow strong and tall in the sweltering heat and sandy soil of Israel. Only He could cultivate vegetation so perfectly that its leaves wouldn&#x2019;t wither in a drought.<br>What this means for us is that whoever has been <i>transplanted </i>into God&#x2019;s garden will flourish. And I really <i>dig </i>(pun intended) the psalmist&#x2019;s use of the term &#x201c;transplanted&#x201d; here, because it implies that salvation is by grace, that because we can&#x2019;t <i>plant ourselves, </i>God plucks us from the dark, sunless place where we&#x2019;d been decaying and lovingly replants us in a perfect spot where we&#x2019;re guaranteed to flourish. We will get bigger and more beautiful, to the point of actually bearing fruit, as we absorb the living water our Creator provides. Plus, when our roots are anchored in Him, even figurative droughts like critical in-laws or financial crises or cancer diagnoses won&#x2019;t destroy us. The &#x201c;leaves&#x201d; of those loved by God don&#x2019;t die.<br>Our heavenly Father&#x2014;who also happens to have a supernatural green thumb&#x2014;promises to nourish and protect His saplings.<br>Before we go any further, you may be wondering about the assertion that &#x201c;everything they do will succeed&#x201d; at the end of verse 3, which at first glance seems about as truthful as the weight listed on my driver&#x2019;s license until our government chose to omit that data (maybe because most people fudged on the amount). How can the psalmist label broken relationships or rebellious children or infertility or crippling depression a success? How can he sincerely sing, &#x201c;Everything they do will succeed,&#x201d; when all of God&#x2019;s children experience failure of some kind or another? Has he been guzzling cough syrup, or is he just<br>wearing overly optimistic blinders?<br>Neither. Because this promise of prosperity is preceded by the context &#x201c;everything they do&#x201d;&#x2014;which in this passage is defined by spiritual obedience&#x2014;&#x201c;succeed&#x201d; in verse 3 is in reference to walking closely with God.6 It&#x2019;s essentially an Old Testament version of Romans 8:28: &#x201c;And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.&#x201d;<br>It doesn&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;ll get everything we want exactly how and when we want it. And it sure doesn&#x2019;t mean everything we do will be judged successful by human standards. What it means is that ultimately our<br>sovereign Redeemer will work <i>everything </i>out for our good and His glory because we are His people and He loves us. It means being in a real, redemptive relationship with the Creator of the universe is the true measure of success.<br><b>THE FLEETING EXISTENCE OF EVIL<br><br></b>God-haters, by contrast, aren&#x2019;t deep rooted or taken care of by a divine gardener; they&#x2019;re more like tumbleweeds that roll across the ground, only to inevitably disintegrate in barbed wire:<br><br>But wicked people are not like that.<br>They are like chaff that the wind blows away.<br><i>Psalm 1:4, NCV<br></i>I recently had oral surgery because the root of an upper molar had fractured in half, leaving me with no option but to have the tooth yanked out of my head. My dentist advised me to get an implant as opposed to an old-fashioned partial or bridge. This means that after the gaping wound from the extraction heals, the surgeon will drill a titanium screw into my jawbone, then when it grafts sufficiently, she&#x2019;ll affix a porcelain crown to the screw and&#x2014;presto!&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll have a shiny new molar that, according to the brochure, will last over two hundred years. (I&#x2019;m not sure why the longevity of the implant is considered a selling point since the rest of me will presumably be long gone by then.)<br>Of course none of this six-thousand-dollar procedure is covered by insurance, and the whole process takes about a year, but I was too loopy from laughing gas to stop and think about the consequences. The worst one being that in place of my trusty old tooth, I now have a &#x201c;flipper&#x201d; (common dental vernacular for the fake tooth patients wear prior to getting the actual implant). Furthermore, because this flipper clips on instead of being secured with adhesive, I have a gap between it and my gum that causes me to talk with a noticeable lisp. Believe me, this is a real bummer when you gab for a living!<br>My dentist told me the tooth trauma actually started with a substandard root canal I had in college, which left me with a compromised chomper that probably cracked when I fell headfirst off a ladder onto a concrete floor a few years ago. He also broke the news that I&#x2019;ll likely need another implant in the near future. Like the hair color I was born with and the steel-trap memory I had in young adulthood, even my permanent teeth have proved to be temporary.<br>Verse 4 explains that the wicked won&#x2019;t last either. Oh, they may have their season in the sun when it seems as if they&#x2019;re sitting on top of the world. But their days are numbered. It won&#x2019;t be long before God yanks those who defy Him out of their abscessed existence. Their chance of survival matches that of a snowball in the Sahara!<br><br><b>THEIR TRAGIC TRAIL&#x2019;S END<br><br></b>All three of my aunts have worked in public education. One has been a middle-school teacher for decades, and the other two have taught in the classroom and also worked in administration. One of them recently told me about having to expel a high-school senior for attempting to sell prescription<br>drugs two weeks before the end of the school year. This kid was all set to start college in the fall when he chose to become a Vicodin vendor. But my aunt didn&#x2019;t have the luxury of lenience, despite his status as a soon-to-be graduate. When this student should have been laughing with his buddies in the locker room, he was instead being handcuffed and hauled off to jail. When he should have been striding across the stage to receive his diploma and then smiling into the camera lens of his proud papa, he was instead ostracized and alone. When he should&#x2019;ve been listening to the lectures of university professors as a baby-faced freshman, he was instead repeating lessons from his last semester in high school. Because of very bad choices, this young man was severely punished. He was effectively barred from the life he could have enjoyed.<br>And so it is with the wicked. Instead of being happy and content in communion with our Creator,unrepentant sinners will ultimately be cut off from the land of the living. They will <i>not </i>pass Go, they will <i>not </i>collect two hundred dollars, and they will <i>not </i>get to graduate to glory with their classmates:<br><br>So the wicked will not escape God&#x2019;s punishment.<br>Sinners will not worship with God&#x2019;s people.<br><i>Psalm 1:5, NCV<br></i><b>OUR CONSTANT OBSERVER<br><br></b>I recently had a motion-activated camera installed on my back porch by the Williamson County Sheriff &#x2019;s Department (chapter 7 tells the Paul Harvey part of this story). Unfortunately I didn&#x2019;t realize that along with the ability to capture burglars in a digital format, it also recorded me every time I opened or closed the back door. A week later one of the detectives came by to change the battery and started teasing about arresting me on animal-cruelty charges. He explained how he and several other deputies had gotten a big kick out of watching the footage of my leg stepping through a crack in the door, followed by my cat Lazarus sailing through the air like a Frisbee.<br>I was so embarrassed, because I love animals. But my recently adopted, houseplant-shredding tabby is a feisty little critter. Whenever I gently place Lazarus outside, he races back in before I can close the door and then attempts to shred something else before I nab him again. So I&#x2019;ve gotten into the habit of tossing him a short distance so I can close the door without squashing any part of his anatomy in the process. (Don&#x2019;t worry. He always lands unharmed on his feet.) Little did I know that my nightly cat toss was being viewed in living color by local law-enforcement officials. They were privy to everything; in fact, their vantage point was so intimate, they could even tell the color of my pajamas!<br>The next section of Psalm 1 is all about God&#x2019;s observation of us.

Facts are few, stories many. He seems to have been known by different names in many parts of India, appearing and disappearing through the years. His western devotees of recent years knew him as &#39;Neem Karoli Baba,&#39; but mostly as &#39;Maharajii&#39;--a nickname so commonplace in India that one can often hear a tea vendor addressed thus. Just as he said, he was &#39;Nobody.&#39; He gave no discourses; the briefest, simplest stories were his teachings. Usually he sat or lay on a wooden bench wrapped in a plaid blanket while a few devotees sat around him. Visitors came and went; they were given food, a few words, a nod, a slap on the head or back, and they were sent away. There was gossip and laughter for he loved to joke. Orders for running the ashram were given, usually in a piercing yell across the compound. Sometimes he sat in silence, absorbed in another world to which we could not follow, but bliss and peace poured down on us. Who he was was no more than the experience of him, the nectar of his presence, the totality of his absence--enveloping us now like his plaid blanket. --Anjani In 1967 I met Neem Karoli Baba, a meeting which changed the course of my life. In the depth of his compassion, wisdom, humor, power and love I found human possibility never before imagined...an extraordinary integration of spirit and form. I was with him only briefly for he left his body in 1973, still he entered my heart as living truth, and his presence continues to enrich and guide my life. -- Ram Dass</p><p></p><h2>The New Rules of War: How America Can Win--Against Russia, China, and Other Threats</h2><p><p><strong>"Stunning.

But spring was quite a bit away because the year had only just got a little past New Year&#x2019;s.At the point where the valley began its soft slope toward the mountains stood a snowed-in house. It looked very lonely and rather like a crazy drift of snow. Quite near it ran a bend of the river, coal-black between ice-edges. The current kept the stream open all winter. But there were no tracks leading over the bridge, and no one had touched the snow-drifts around the house.Inside, the house was warm and cozy. Heaps of peat were quietly smoldering in the central-heating stove down in the cellar. The moon looked in sometimes at the drawing-room window, lighting on the white winter covers of the chairs and on the cut-glass chandelier in its white gauze dust cover. And in the drawing room also, grouped around the biggest porcelain stove of the house, the Moomin family lay sleeping their long winter sleep.They always slept from November to April, because such was the custom of their forefathers, and Moomins stick to tradition. They all had a good meal of pine needles in their stomachs, just as their ancestors used to have, and beside their beds each had hopefully laid out everything likely to be needed in early spring: spades, magnifying glasses and films, wind gauges, and the like.The silence was deep and expectant.Every now and then somebody sighed and curled deeper down under the quilt.The streak of moonlight wandered from rocking chair to drawing-room table, crawled over the brass knobs of the bed end, and shone straight in Moomintroll&#x2019;s face.And now something happened that had never happened before, not since the first Moomin took to his hibernating den. Moomintroll awoke and found that he couldn&#x2019;t go back to sleep again.He looked at the moonlight and the ice ferns on the window. He listened to the humming of the stove in the cellar and felt more and more awake and astonished. Finally he rose and padded over to Moominmamma&#x2019;s bed.He pulled at her ear very cautiously, but she didn&#x2019;t awake. She just curled into an uninterested ball.&#x201c;If not even Mother wakes up it&#x2019;s no use trying the others,&#x201d; Moomintroll thought and went along by himself on a round through the unfamiliar and mysterious house. All the clocks had stopped ages ago, and a fine coat of dust covered everything. On the drawing-room table still stood the soup tureen with pine needles left over from November. And inside its muslin dress the cut-glass chandelier was softly jingling to itself.All at once Moomintroll felt frightened and stopped short in the warm darkness beside the streak of moon-light. He was so terribly lonely.&#x201c;Mother! Wake up!&#x201d; Moomintroll shouted. &#x201c;All the world&#x2019;s got lost!&#x201d; He went back and pulled at her quilt.But Moominmamma didn&#x2019;t wake up. For a moment her dreams of summer became uneasy and troubled, but she wasn&#x2019;t able to open her eyes. Moomintroll curled up on the rug next to her bed, and the long winter night went on.At dawn the snowdrift on the roof began to move. It went slithering down a bit, then it resolutely coasted over the roof edge and sat down with a soft thump.Now all the windows were buried, and only a weak grey light found its way inside. The drawing room looked more unreal than ever, as if it were deep under the earth.Moomintroll pricked up his ears and listened long. Then he lit the oil lamp and padded along to the chest of drawers to read Snufkin&#x2019;s spring letter. It lay, as usual, under the little meerschaum tram car, and it was very much like the other spring letters that Snufkin had left behind when he went off to the South each year in October.It began with the word &#x201c;Cheerio&#x201d; in his big round hand. The letter itself was short:CHEERIOSleep well and keep your chin up. First warm spring day you&#x2019;ll have me here again. Don&#x2019;t start the dam building without me.SNUFKINMoomintroll read the letter several times, and suddenly he felt hungry.He went out in the kitchen. It, too, was miles and miles under the earth, as it were, and looked dismally tidy and empty. The larder was just as desolate. He found nothing there, except a bottle of loganberry syrup that had fermented, and half a packet of dusty crackers.Moomintroll made himself comfortable under the kitchen table and began to chew. He read Snufkin&#x2019;s letter once more.After that he stretched out on his back and looked at the square wooden clumps under the table corners. The kitchen was silent.&#x201c;Cheerio,&#x201d; whispered Moomintroll. &#x201c;Sleep well and keep your chin up. First warm spring day,&#x201d; he said, slightly louder. And then he sang at the top of his voice: &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have me here again! You&#x2019;ll have me here, and spring&#x2019;s in the air, and it&#x2019;s warm and fair, and we&#x2019;ll be here, and there we are, and here and there in any year&#x2014;&#x201d;He stopped short when he caught sight of two small eyes that gleamed out at him from under the sink.He stared back, and the kitchen was silent as before. Then the eyes disappeared.&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Moomintroll shouted anxiously. He crept toward the sink, softly calling all the while: &#x201c;Come out, won&#x2019;t you? Don&#x2019;t be afraid! I&#x2019;m good. Come back ...&#x201d;But whoever it was that lived under the sink didn&#x2019;t come back. Moomintroll laid out a string of crackercrumbs on the floor and poured a little puddle of loganberry syrup.When he came back to the drawing room the crystals in the chandelier greeted him with a melancholy jingle.&#x201c;I&#x2019;m off,&#x201d; Moomintroll said sternly to the chandelier. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired of you all, and I&#x2019;m going south to meet Snufkin.&#x201d; He went to the front door and tried to open it, but it had frozen fast.He ran whimpering from window to window and tried them all, but they were also stuck hard. And so the lonely Moomintroll rushed up to the attic, managed to lift the chimney-sweep&#x2019;s hatch, and clambered out onto the roof.A wave of cold air received him.He lost his breath, slipped, and rolled over the edge.And so Moomintroll was helplessly thrown out into a strange and dangerous world and dropped up to his ears in the first snowdrift of his experience. It felt unpleasantly prickly to his velvet skin, but at the same time his nose caught a new smell. It was a more serious smell than any he had met before, and slightly frightening. But it made him wide awake and greatly interested.The valley was enveloped in a kind of grey twilight. It also wasn&#x2019;t green any longer, it was white. Everything that had once moved had become immobile. There were no living sounds. Everything angular was now rounded.&#x201c;This is snow,&#x201d; Moomintroll whispered to himself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard about it from Mother, and it&#x2019;s called snow.&#x201d;Without Moomintroll knowing a thing about it, at that moment his velvet skin decided to start growing woollier. It decided to become, by and by, a coat of fur for winter use. That would take some time, but at least the decision was made. And that&#x2019;s always a good thing.Meanwhile Moomintroll was laboriously plodding along through the snow. He went down to the river. It was the same river that used to scuttle, transparent and jolly, through Moomintroll&#x2019;s summer garden. Now it looked quite unlike itself. It was black and listless. It also belonged to this new world in which he didn&#x2019;t feel at home.For safety&#x2019;s sake he looked at the bridge. He looked at the mailbox. They tallied with memory. He raised the lid a little, but there was no mail, except a withered leaf without a word on it.He was already becoming used to the winter smell. It didn&#x2019;t make him feel curious anymore.He looked at the jasmine bush that was an untidy tangle of bare sprigs, and he thought: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s dead. All the world has died while I slept. This world belongs to somebody else whom I don&#x2019;t know. Perhaps to the Groke. It isn&#x2019;t made for Moomins.&#x201d;He hesitated for a moment. Then he decided that he would feel still worse if he were the only one awake among the sleeping.And that was why Moomintroll made the first tracks in the snow, over the bridge and up the slope. They were very small tracks, but they were resolute and pointed straight in among the trees, southward.Excerpted from Moominland Midwinter by Tove Jansson.<br>Copyright � 1957 by Tove Jansson.<br>Published in 2010 by Farrar Straus Giroux.<br>All rights reserved.

Below it was a dais of some sort, standing on a large gently raised mound that was covered in a dusting of snow. A soft light, coming from somewhere high above where the cavern was open to daylight, shone down on the runeblade. The icy prison hid some details of the sword's shape and form, exaggerated others. It was revealed and concealed at the same time, and all the more tempting, like a new lover imperfectly glimpsed through a gauzy curtain. Arthas knew the blade -- it was the selfsame sword he had seen in his dream when he first arrived. The sword that had not killed Invincible, but that had brought him back healed and healthy. He'd thought it a good omen then, but now he knew it was a true sign. This was what he had come to find. This sword would change everything. Arthas stared raptly at it, his hands almost physically aching to grasp it, his fingers to wrap themselves around the hilt, his arms to feel the weapon swinging smoothly in the blow that would end Mal'Ganis, end the torment he had visited upon the people of Lordaeron, end this lust for revenge.

It had been ten minutes since he had spied a dark shape slinking among the gray foothills far below, and Max knew his pursuer would now be close. He unsheathed his knife, using the blade&#x2019;s coat of phosphoroil to study the crude map he&#x2019;d scrawled before setting out. The target was still far away. At this rate, he would never make it&#x2014;this opponent was much faster than the others.<br><br>Shaking off the unpleasant realities, Max concentrated instead on the illusion he had created. The phantasm was a perfect replica of Max, down to its wavy black hair and the sharp, dark features that peered cautiously from a high perch in a nearby tree. He had taken care to mark the surrounding terrain with subtle signs of passage, knowing that a trained eye would spot them.<br><br>The shrill cry of a bird shattered the pre-dawn stillness.<br><br>Something was coming.<br><br>Max&#x2019;s pulse quickened. He scanned the switchback below for any sign of his pursuer, but there was only the smell of damp earth and the low sigh of the wind as it blew tatters of mist across the mountain.<br><br>While the sky brightened to a thin wash of blue, Max watched and waited, still as a stone among the roots and nettles. Just when he had decided to abandon his position, a flicker of motion caught his eye.<br><br>One of the trees was creeping up the mountainside.<br><br>At least he had thought the shape was a tree&#x2014;one of several bent and broken saplings clinging precariously to the slope&#x2019;s dry soil. Slowly, however, the silhouette straightened and began to thread its way up through the sparse wood. It crept toward Max&#x2019;s double, as dark and shrouded as a specter. When the figure was some twenty feet away, Max realized why he had been unable to shake the pursuer.<br><br>It was Cooper.<br><br>The Agent&#x2019;s scarred and ruined face looked like a fractured mask of weathered bone. His pale skin was camouflaged with dirt; his telltale shoots of blond hair were tucked beneath a black skullcap. Reaching the base of the tree on which Max&#x2019;s double was perched, he drew a thin knife from a sheath on his forearm. Its blade gleamed with phosphoroil.<br><br>Cooper began climbing the tree with the fluid ease of a spider.<br><br>While the Agent climbed, Max&#x2019;s pupils slowly dilated. Terrible energies filled his wiry form, making his fingers twitch and tremble.<br><br>Max sprang from his hiding place.<br><br>Cooper&#x2019;s head cocked at the sound as Max hurtled toward him with his knife.<br><br>Max&#x2019;s weapon struck home, but instead of meeting flesh and bone, it passed through the figure to thud against the tree in a spray of bark. Cooper&#x2019;s conjured decoy dissolved in a billow of black smoke and Max realized he&#x2019;d been duped.<br><br>Max whipped his head around and spied the real Cooper darting out from a nearby thicket. The Agent closed the distance in five long strides. Shifting his knife to his left hand, Max swung himself up into the tree as Cooper&#x2019;s blade whistled past his ribs.<br><br>Cooper seized Max&#x2019;s wrist in a grip of iron. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re caught,&#x201d; he hissed.<br><br>With a terrible wrench, Max pulled himself free and sliced his own knife across Cooper&#x2019;s shoulder, leaving a bright line of phosphoroil on the black fabric. Cooper gave a grunt of surprise. Slashing the Agent again, Max leapt clear of the tree.<br><br>In one fluid movement, Max landed and bolted up the path, veering right at the fork and dashing up the steep trail he had marked on the map. Cooper trotted after him, apparently unconcerned that Max was increasing his lead with a burst of Amplified speed. Ignoring Cooper for the moment, Max focused his attention on the coppery summit as he raced up the mountain, climbing steadily above the timberline.<br><br>It was ten minutes of hard running before Max spied a small white pennant fluttering from a distant peak of jagged rock. He fixed its position in his memory and grinned in spite of himself. Another ten minutes at this pace and he would be victorious.<br><br>As he ran on, however, his breathing was reduced to shallow gasps and then to agonizing, frantic swallows as the air became unbearably thin. A quick glance behind revealed that Cooper had closed to a hundred yards and was running as evenly as ever. Max spat on the path and increased his pace, coughing as he climbed.<br><br>The pennant was tantalizingly close, but the pain and dizziness became overwhelming. Tiny motes of light swam before Max&#x2019;s eyes; his mouth felt as if it were full of hot sand. Stumbling over a rock, he spilled onto the ground, scraping his knee and dropping his knife. He scrambled to his feet just as a blurred shape came into view.<br><br>Cooper stood ten feet away, his sturdy black boot planted squarely on the hilt of Max&#x2019;s knife.<br><br>The Agent&#x2019;s eyes were locked on Max. His chest rose and fell in long, slow breaths as he flicked a cold glance at the red patch on Max&#x2019;s uniform. The patch was a target, positioned directly over Max&#x2019;s heart. A successful strike there signified a kill and would bring the exercise to an abrupt finish.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you submit?&#x201d; came Cooper&#x2019;s clipped Cockney accent.<br><br>Max paused a moment, crouched in a defensive posture while he considered Cooper&#x2019;s offer.<br><br>The very instant Max made his decision, the Agent reacted so swiftly, it was as though he had read Max&#x2019;s mind. Before Max had even moved, Cooper flicked his wrist and sent the thin black knife darting toward the patch on Max&#x2019;s chest.</p><h2>Battleborn</h2><p><b><b>The extraordinary debut collection from the Guggenheim Award-winning author of the forthcoming Gold&nbsp;<i>Fame Citrus</i>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Winner of the 2012 Story Prize<br>Recipient of the American Academy of Arts and Letters 2013 Rosenthal Family Foundation Award<br>Named one of the National Book Foundation's "5 Under 35" fiction writers of 2012<br>Winner of New York Public Library Young Lions Fiction Award<br>NPR Best Short Story Collections of 2012&nbsp;<br>A Boston Globe, San Francisco Chronicle, and Time Out New York Best Book of the year, and more . . .</b></b><br><br> Like the work of Cormac McCarthy, Denis Johnson, Richard Ford, and Annie Proulx, <i>Battleborn </i>represents a near-perfect confluence of sensibility and setting, and the introduction of an exceptionally powerful and original literary voice. In each of these ten unforgettable stories, Claire Vaye Watkins writes her way fearlessly into the mythology of the American West, utterly reimagining it. Her characters orbit around the region's vast spaces, winning redemption despite - and often because of - the hardship and violence they endure. The arrival of a foreigner transforms the exchange of eroticism and emotion at a prostitution ranch. A prospecting hermit discovers the limits of his rugged individualism when he tries to rescue an abused teenager. Decades after she led her best friend into a degrading encounter in a Vegas hotel room, a woman feels the aftershock. Most bravely of all, Watkins takes on &#x2013; and reinvents&nbsp;&#x2013; her own troubled legacy in a story that emerges from the mayhem and destruction of Helter Skelter. Arcing from the sweeping and sublime to the minute and personal, from Gold Rush to ghost town to desert to brothel, the collection echoes not only in its title but also in its fierce, undefeated spirit the motto of her home state.</p><p><b><b>Claire Vaye Watkins</b>&nbsp;</b>is the author of <i>Battleborn</i>, winner of the Story Prize, the Rosenthal Family Foundation Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and a Silver Pen Award from the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame. <i>Battleborn </i>was named a Best Book of 2012 by the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, <i>Boston Globe</i>, <i>Time Out New York </i>and <i>Flavorwire</i>,&nbsp;and a Best Short Story Collection by NPR.org.

At the end, I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about beginnings.</p><p>The city of Reno, Nevada, was founded in 1859 when Charles Fuller built a log toll bridge across the Truckee River and charged prospectors to haul their Comstock silver across the narrow but swift-moving current. Two years later, Fuller sold the bridge to the ambitious Myron Lake. Lake, swift himself, added a gristmill, kiln and livery stable to his Silver Queen Hotel and Eating House. Not a bashful man, he named the community Lake&#x2019;s Crossing, had the name painted on Fuller&#x2019;s bridge, bright blue as the sky.</p><p>The 1860s were boom times in the western Utah Territory: Americans still had the brackish taste of Sutter&#x2019;s soil on their tongues, ten-year-old gold still glinting in their eyes. The curse of the Comstock Lode had not yet leaked from the silver vein, not seeped into the water table. The silver itself had not yet been stripped from the mountains, and steaming water had not yet ?ooded the mine shafts. Henry T. P. Comstock&#x2014;most opportune of the opportunists, snatcher of land, greatest claim jumper of all time&#x2014;had not yet lost his love Adelaide, his ?rst cousin, who drowned in Lake Tahoe. He had not yet traded his share of the lode for a bottle of whiskey and an old, blind mare, not yet blown his brains out with a borrowed revolver near Bozeman, Montana.</p><p>Boom times.</p><p>Lake&#x2019;s Crossing grew. At statehood in 1864, the district of Lake&#x2019;s Crossing, Washoe County, was consolidated with Roop County. By then, Lake&#x2019;s Crossing was the largest city in either. The curse, excavated from the silver vein and weighted by the heavy ore, settled on the nation&#x2019;s newest free state.</p><p>Or begin the story here: In 1881 Himmel Green, an architect, came to Reno from San Francisco to quietly divorce Mary Ann Cohen Magnin of the upscale women&#x2019;s clothing store I. Magnin and Company. Himmel took a liking to Reno and decided to stay. He started designing buildings for his friends, newly rich silver families.</p><p>Reno&#x2019;s Newlands Heights neighborhood is choked with Green&#x2019;s work. In 1909, 315 Lake Street was erected. A stout building made of brick, it was one of Himmel&#x2019;s ?rst residential buildings, a modest design, small porch off the back, simple awnings, thoroughly mediocre in every way. Some say construction at 315 Lake stirred up the cursed dust of the Comstock Lode. Though it contaminated everyone (and though we Nevadans still breathe it into ourselves today), they say it got to Himmel particularly, stuck to his blueprints, his clothing, formed a microscopic layer of silver dust on his skin. Glinting silver ?lm or no, after his divorce was ?nalized Himmel moved in with Leopold Karpeles, editor of the B&#x2019;nai B&#x2019;rith Messenger. Their relationship was rumored a tumultuous one, mottled with abuse and in?delity. Still, they lived together until 1932, when the two were burned to death in a ?re at Karpeles&#x2019;s home, smoke rising from the house smelling like those miners boiled alive up in Virginia City mine shafts.</p><p>Or here. Here is as good a place as any: In March 1941, George Spahn, a dairyman and amateur beekeeper from Pennsylvania, signed over the deed to his sixty-acre farm to his son, Henry, packed four suitcases, his wife, Helen, and their old, foul-tempered calico cat, Bottles, into the car, and drove west to California, to the ocean.</p><p>He was to retire, bow out of the ranching business, bury his tired feet in the warm Western sand. But retirement didn&#x2019;t suit George. After two months he came home to their ticky-tacky rental on the beach and presented Helen with plans to buy a 511-acre ranch at 1200 Santa Susana Pass Road in the Santa Susana Mountains. The ranch was up for sale by its owner, the aging silent-?lm star William S. Hart.</p><p>The Santa Susana Mountains are drier than the more picturesque Santa Monica Mountains that line the California coast. Because they are not privy to the moist winds rolling in off the sea, they are susceptible to ? res. Twelve hundred Santa Susana Pass Road is tucked up in the Santa Susanas north of Los Angeles, off what is now called the Ronald Reagan Freeway. Back in 1941, when George was persuading Helen to move again, taking her knobby hand in his, begging her to uproot the tendrils she&#x2019;d so far managed to anchor into the loose beige sand of Manhattan Beach&#x2014;<i>Just a bit east this time</i>, sweet pea&#x2014;the city of Chatsworth was little more than a Baptist church, a dirt-clogged ?lling station, and the Palomino Horse Association&#x2019;s main stables, birthplace of Mr. Ed. Years later, in 1961, my father, still a boy, would start a wild?re in the hills above the PHA stables. He would be eleven, crouched in the dry brush, sneaking a cigarette. But let&#x2019;s not get ahead of ourselves.</p><p>At the heart of the ranch was a movie set, a thoroughfare of a Western boomtown: bank, saloon, blacksmith, wood-planked boardwalk, side streets and alleys, a jail. Perhaps the set dazzled Helen. Perhaps she&#x2014;a prematurely arthritic woman&#x2014;recalled the aching cold of Pennsylvania winters. Perhaps she spoiled her husband, as her children claim. Whatever the reason, Helen laid her hand on her husband&#x2019;s brow and said, &#x201c;All right, George.&#x201d; And though by all accounts Helen came to like the ranch, on the day George took her out to view the property for the ?rst time her journal reads:</p><p><i>The property is quite expansive, surrounded by mountains.</i></p><i> </i><p><i>G. giddy as a boy. Not such a view as the beach, though. The road out is windy and narrow, sheer canyon walls on either side. Seems I am to be once again separated from the sea. And what a brief affair it was! Looking west I felt a twinge like something had been taken from me, something a part of me but never truly mine.</i></p><p>Within a week of the Spahns&#x2019; move up to 1200 Santa Susana Pass Road, Bottles the cat ran away.</p><p>But George was more adaptable than Bottles, and luckier. In 1941, Westerns were still Hollywood&#x2019;s bread and butter. George ran his movie set like he&#x2019;d run his dairy ranch, building strong relationships with decision makers, underpricing the competition. It certainly didn&#x2019;t hurt business when Malibu Bluff State Recreation Area annexed Trancas Canyon and sold off its many sets, making Spahn&#x2019;s Ranch the only privately owned&#x2014;and therefore zero-permit&#x2014;outdoor set for seventy-?ve miles. The Spahns enjoyed a steady stream of business from the major studios, charging them a pretty penny to rent horses and shoot ?lms at the ranch, among them High Noon, The Comstock Boys, and David O. Selznick&#x2019;s 1946 classic <i>Duel in the Sun</i>, starring Gregory Peck. TV shows were also shot at the ranch, including most episodes of The Lone Ranger and&#x2014;before Warner Brothers, coaxed by Nevada&#x2019;s tax incentives and the habits of its big-name directors, moved production to the Ponderosa Ranch at Lake Tahoe&#x2014;<i>Bonanza</i>.</p><p>We might start at my mother&#x2019;s ?rst memory: It&#x2019;s 1962. She is three. She sits on her stepfather&#x2019;s lap on a plastic lawn chair on the roof of their trailer. Her older brother and sister sit cross-legged on a bath towel they&#x2019;ve laid atop the chintzy two-tab roof, the terry cloth dimpling their skin. They each wear a pair of their mother&#x2019;s&#x2014;my grandmother&#x2019;s&#x2014;oversize Jackie O. sunglasses. It is dusk; in the eastern sky stars are coming into view&#x2014;yes, back then you could still see stars over Las Vegas&#x2014;but the family faces northwest, as do their neighbors and the teenage boys hired to cut and water the grass at the new golf courses and the city bus drivers who have pulled over to the side of the roads and the tourists up in their hotel rooms with their faces pressed to the windows. As does the whole city.</p><p>Their stepfather points to the desert. &#x201c;There,&#x201d; he says. A ?ash of light across the basin. An orange mushroom cloud erupts, rolling and boiling. Seconds later, she hears the boom of it, like a ?rework, and the trailer begins to sway. Impossibly, the heat warms my mother&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Makes you think,&#x201d; her stepfather says softly in her ear. &#x201c;Maybe there&#x2019;s something godly out there after all.&#x201d;</p><p>The blast is a 104-kiloton nuclear explosion. It blows a hole into the desert rock, creating the deepest crater of all the Nevada Test Site&#x2019;s 1,021 detonations: 320 feet deep. The crater displaces seven hundred tons of dirt and rock, including two tons of sediment from a vein of H. T. P. Comstock&#x2019;s cursed soil, a ?nger reaching all the way down the state, now blown sky-high in the blast. The July breeze is gentle, indecisive. It blows the radiation northeast, as it always does, to future cancer clusters in Fallon and Cedar City, Utah, to the mitosing cells of small-town downwinders. But today it also blows the curse southeast, toward Las Vegas, to my mother&#x2019;s small chest, her lungs and her heart. And it blows southwest, across the state line, all the way to the dry yellow mountains above Los Angeles. These particles settle, ?nally, at 1200 Santa Susana Pass Road.</p><p>We might start with George&#x2019;s longest year: For nearly twenty years, George&#x2019;s letters to his son, Henry, back home in Pennsylvania were characteristically dry, questions about herd count, tips for working the swarm at honey harvest; he hardly mentioned his own ranch, which to his son would not have seemed a ranch at all.</p><p>But by the early 1960s the demand for Westerns began to wane and George Spahn blamed, among others, Alfred Hitchcock. He increasingly ended his notes about farm business with aggravated rants about &#x201c;cut-&#x2019;em-ups,&#x201d; and&#x201c; sex-crazed&#x201d; moviegoers&#x2019; ?xation on horror ?lms, probably meaning Hitchcock&#x2019;s <i>Psycho</i>, the second-highest-grossing ?lm of 1960, after <i>Swiss Family Robinson</i>. On the ?rst day of February 1966, George Spahn ?led for bankruptcy. By then, unbeknownst to George, his wife&#x2019;s kidneys were marbled with tumors. Six weeks later, at UCLA Medical Center, Helen died from renal failure on the same ?oor where my father would die thirty-four years later. The coroner&#x2019;s report noted that her tumors were visible, and in the glaring light of the microscope seemed &#x201c;like hundreds of hairlike silver ribbons.&#x201d;</p><p>After Helen&#x2019;s death, George neglected the few already tenuous ties he had at the big studios. He wrote Henry often, spoke of the ranch deteriorating, of weeds pushing up through the soil in the corrals.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired,&#x201d; he wrote to his son on July 23, 1966. &#x201c;Let most everyone [three part-time ranch hands] go. It is hot here. So hot I have to wait for dusk to feed the horses. They get impatient down in the stalls and kick the empty troughs over. Boy, you wouldn&#x2019;t believe the noise of their hoofs against the metal . . .&#x201d;</p><p>In the end it was the horses, thirsty or not, that kept Spahn&#x2019;s Ranch a?oat. Spahn rented the horses to tourists for self-guided rides through the hills. Occasionally, a few of George&#x2019;s old studio friends would throw business his way, sending for six or eight paints when a scene couldn&#x2019;t have needed more than two. And so the horses became George&#x2019;s main source of income, meager as it was. The Los Angeles County tax records show Spahn&#x2019;s annual income in 1967 to be $13,120, less than a quarter of what it was in 1956.</p><p>In previous letters, George rarely wrote of Helen. When he did his lines were terse, referring to her only along with other ranch business: &#x201c;Storm coming in. Your mother&#x2019;s knuckles would have swelled. Lord knows we need the rain.&#x201d;</p><p>That year, George continued to write even as his eyesight failed, his lines sometimes piling atop one another. He began to write of Helen more frequently, sometimes devoting an entire page to her blackberry cobbler or the fragrance of her bath talcum. These are the only letters in which George, otherwise a deliberate and correct writer, slips into the present tense.</p><p>In September, George reported discovering a tiny bleached skull in the hills above his cabin. &#x201c;Bottles,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;picked clean by coyotes.&#x201d;</p><p>Or here. Begin here: When a group of about ten young people&#x2014;most of them teenagers, one of them my father&#x2014;arrived at the ranch in January of 1968, having hitchhiked from San Francisco, George was nearly blind. Surely he smelled them, though, as they approached his porch&#x2014;sweat, gasoline, the thick semisweet guff of marijuana. The group offered to help George with chores and maintenance in exchange for permission to camp out in the empty facaded set buildings. Though he&#x2019;d broken down and hired a hand a couple weeks earlier&#x2014;a nice kid, a bit macho, went by &#x201c;Shorty,&#x201d; wanted to be, what else?, an actor&#x2014;George agreed, perhaps because he wouldn&#x2019;t have to pay them. Or perhaps because the group&#x2019;s leader&#x2014;a man named Charlie&#x2014;offered to leave a young girl or two with George twenty-four-seven, to cook his meals, tidy the house, keep up with the laundry, and bed him whenever he wanted.</p><p>My father didn&#x2019;t kill anyone. And he&#x2019;s not a hero. It isn&#x2019;t that kind of story.</p><p>Nearly everyone who spent time at Spahn&#x2019;s that summer wrote a book after it was over, Bugliosi&#x2019;s only the most lucrative. We know, from the books of those who noticed, that a baby was born at Spahn&#x2019;s Ranch, likely April ninth, though accounts vary. In her version, Olivia Hall, who&#x2019;d been a senior at Paci?c Palisades High School and an occasional participant in group sex at the ranch, wrote of the birth: &#x201c;The mother, splayed out on the wood ?oor of the jail, struggled in labor for nearly fourteen hours, through the night and into the early morning, then gave up.&#x201d; In <i>The Manson Murders: One Woman&#x2019;s Escape</i>, Carla Shapiro, now a mother of four boys, says the struggling girl &#x201c;let her head roll back onto a sleeping bag and would not push. Then Manson took over.&#x201d; My father&#x2019;s book reads, &#x201c;Charlie held a cigarette lighter under a razor blade until the blade was hot and sliced the girl from vagina to anus. &#x201d;The baby girl slipped out, wailing, into Charlie&#x2019;s arms. My father: &#x201c;The place was a mess. Blood and clothes everywhere. I don&#x2019;t know where he found the razor blade.&#x201d;</p><p>Charlie had a rule against couples. The group had nightly orgies at the ranch and before it in Topanga, Santa Barbara, Big Sur, Santa Cruz, Monterey, Oakland, San Francisco, the list goes on. You know this part, I&#x2019;m sure. The drugs, the sex. People came and went. Tracing the child&#x2019;s paternity was impossible, even if the group had been interested in that sort of thing. &#x201c;There was a birth, I know that,&#x201d; Tex Watson wrote to me from prison. &#x201c;Hell, might&#x2019;ve been mine. But we were all pretty gone, you know?&#x201d;</p><p>Of the mother, the accounts mention only how young she was. No name, no explanation of how she came to the ranch. One calls her &#x201c;dew-faced.&#x201d; In his account my father admits to having sex with her on several occasions. He says, &#x201c;She was a good kid.&#x201d;</p><p>After police raided Spahn&#x2019;s on August sixteenth, California Child Protective Services placed the baby with foster parents, Al and Vaye Orlando of Orlando&#x2019;s Furniture Warehouse in Thousand Oaks. Vaye constantly fussed over the baby, worried at her calmness, what she called &#x201c;a blankness in her face.&#x201d; During the child&#x2019;s ?rst ?ve years, Vaye had her examined for autism seven times, never trusting the results. She even hired a special nanny to play games with the child, encourage her cognitive development. Al thought this a waste of money.</p><p>Now the baby is a grown woman, forty. She is slender but not slight, and moves like liquid d...</p></p><h2>Christopher and His Kind, 1929-1939</h2><p>Describes ten years in the writer&#39;s life, from 1929 when he left England for a stay in Berlin, through his years of wanderings around a troubled Europe to his 1939 arrival in the United States</p><p>Christopher Isherwood (1902-86) lived in Berlin from 1928 to 1933 and immigrated to the United States in 1939.

Russel and Mary Wright recognized decades ago that finding time to organize their lives and homes would become a priority for modern men and women. In their groundbreaking book, Guide to Easier Living, the Wrights offered simple ways to achieve a comfortable, well-designed, and organized living environment in any home for any family. &lt; BR&gt; Originally published in 1950, Gibbs Smith is proud to rerelease Guide to Easier Living, and to reintroduce the Wrights' time-tested and proven methods for maintaining an inviting and efficient home. From ways to make household chores as fast and painless as possible, to how to organize a room for maximum living space, the Wrights pioneered a new informal way of living for a newly suburban American public. The Wrights' ideas revolutionized American living and the way everyday people dealt with the unending job of keeping a home in order. These methods and ideas are just as relevant-if not more so-today as they were a half-century ago. &lt; BR&gt; Russel and Mary Wright were prominent and successful designers who pioneered the fusion of modern design and informal living. Most importantly, they were known for their tabletop designs. The Wrights' most famous tabletop design, American Modern, was the best-selling dinnerware in American history and has just been rereleased by Oneida Ltd. &lt; BR&gt;</p><p>Whether you live in a city or in the country, whether you have modern or traditional furnishings, you probably work much too hard at the job of keeping your home in order. In Guide to Easier Living (1950), Russel and Mary Wright solve this problem by encouraging people to discard rigid, old-fashioned patterns and create a new informal standard. The Wrights&#39; truly revolutionary contribution to American living is still applicable today as it was when the book was first published. With the intention of making good American design available to everyone, the authors offer timeless advice, such as how to plan the arrangement of rooms to serve their purposes most efficiently, how to choose the most practical furniture and lighting for your specific needs, and much more information geared toward &#34;increasing the enjoyment and satisfaction of life in your home.&#34; Should not the reader expect, then, that by following this well-charted course and applying the principles to one&#39;s own home, one can create a comfortable, well-designed, and organized living space?

Once he arrives in the City of Light,&#x201d; he meets a young German artist, Felix von Bredow, whose larger-than-life personality overshadows his inferior artistic ability, and the handsome and gifted artist Rene Levi, whose colossal talent will later serve to destroy him.

The operation was sanctioned by President Thomas Jefferson, who at the last moment grew wary of "intermeddling" in a foreign government and sent Eaton off without proper national support. Short on supplies, given very little money and only a few men, Eaton and his mission seemed doomed from the start. He triumphed against all odds, recruited a band of European mercenaries in Alexandria, and led them on a march across the Libyan Desert. Once in Tripoli, the ragtag army defeated the local troops and successfully captured Derne, laying the groundwork for the demise of the Barbary Pirates. Now, Richard Zacks brings this important story of America's first overseas covert op to life.</p></p><p><b>Richard Zacks</b> is a graduate of the Columbia Journalism School, a former syndicated columnist for the <em>New York Daily News</em>, and a freelance journalist for <em>Atlantic Monthly, Time, </em>the <em>Village Voice, London Times, Life, </em>and other publications.The author of <i>The Pirate Hunter</i>,which made Captain Kidd come to life, focuses here more broadly on a piracy hot spot. Resolved to stop the enslavement of American merchant sailors by North African nations, Jefferson deployed most of the infant U.S. Navy to the Mediterranean and sent a column of troops overland from Egypt to place the pasha of Tripoli's brother Hamet on the throne in 1801. The leader of that motley array of mercenaries, Muslim tribesmen, Hamet's retainers and a handful of U.S. Marines was the colorful and combative William Eaton, who led them more than 500 miles across the desert to "the shores of Tripoli." By the time he arrived, peace negotiations were underway, in the hands of one Tobias Deane, who was neither honest nor competent. Eaton had to abandon Hamet and was in turn virtually abandoned by the Jefferson administration, leaving him with a mountain of debt and a drinking problem that eventually killed him at 47. There has been a dearth of good material on the Barbary War and particularly on Eaton's trek; Zacks has researched thoroughly, writes entertainingly and shows a knack for sea stories and characterization. This is the book that Captain Eaton has long deserved. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But in 1987, while illustrating THE BOY OF THE THREE-YEAR NAP (Caldecott Honor Medal), he recaptured the joy he had known as a boy working in his master&#39;s studio. It was then that Say decided to make a full commitment to doing what he loves best: writing and illustrating children&#39;s books. Since then, he has written and illustrated many books, including TREE OF CRANES and GRANDFATHER&#39;S JOURNEY, winner of the 1994 Caldecott Medal. He is a full-time writer and illustrator living in Portland, Oregon.Grade 2-5-- A picture-book biography of the first Chinese matador. On his first vacation to Europe, Billy Wong saw a Spanish bullfight and, marvelling at the athletic prowess of the matador, realized that even a man shorter than he might enter the sport. So he stayed in Spain and went to bullfighting school, but after two years passed without fighting a single cow, Billy realized that a Chinese matador might stand out in the crowd of aspiring bullfighters--as indeed he did. After his first success as El Chino --The Chinese--in his native costume, Billy receivedan offer to become a real matador. The large, bordered illustrations in the first part of the book describe Billy's early life in Arizona, and are suggestive of old sepia photographs; these have that sense of being posed in that way that both conceals and reveals the life of the subjects. When he attends the bullfight in Spain, however, the illustrations take on color and action. Say's subtle watercolor shadings and the details in the fine lines of these illustrations capture the power and the sensitivity of this story of a man who learns that to become someone beyond his current self, he must first truly be himself. A book that's lovely to look at, but one that is likely to have limited appeal to children because of the slow, uneventful beginning. --Kay E.

Blossom the cow was long beyond her prime as a milk producer. Her owner, Mr. Dakin, had confided to Mr. Herriot that he had regretfully decided that old Blossom must be sold, and she was taken away by the local cattle-drover. Blossom, however, had other ideas. She accompanied the drover as far as the nearest village, then broke away from the herd, and ran back home. Mr. Dakin reconsidered his earlier decision and decided to let Blossom stay at her old home as a calf feeder rather than as a milk producer. The text is enhanced by soft, sometimes dark, illustrations on each two-page spread. Brown has added a great deal of character to the story with her detailed watercolors. Children who have enjoyed Herriot's Moses the Kitten (1984) and Only One Woof (1985, both St. Martin's) will undoubtedly enjoy this one, too. --Eldon Younce, Harper Elementary School, KS<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The New Paradigm for Financial Markets: The Credit Crisis of 2008 and What It Means</h2><p>In the midst of the most serious financial upheaval since the Great Depression, legendary financier George Soros explores the origins of the crisis and its implications for the future. Soros, whose breadth of experience in financial markets is unrivaled, places the current crisis in the context of decades of study of how individuals and institutions handle the boom and bust cycles that now dominate global economic activity. &#x201c;This is the worst financial crisis since the 1930s,&#x201d; writes Soros in characterizing the scale of financial distress spreading across Wall Street and other financial centers around the world. In a concise essay that combines practical insight with philosophical depth, Soros makes an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the great credit crisis and its implications for our nation and the world.</p><p><b>George Soros</b> is chairman of Soros Fund Management and is the founder of a global network of foundations dedicated to supporting open societies.

The bubble formed over the last twenty-five years when a series of prevailing trends led to credit expansion with minimal regulations. Since the interaction between a trend and misconception is reflexive, the current crisis is the result of unsustainable trends and misconceptions, Soros says.</p></p><h2>ABCs of Serging: A Complete Guide To Serger Sewing Basics (Creative Machine Arts Series)</h2><p><b>No More Fear of Serging!</b><p>Are you a serger 'fraidy-cat?

Generating cataclysmic volcanic eruptions and large earthquakes, the hotspot helped lift the Yellowstone Plateau to more than 7,000 feet and pushed the northern Rockies to new heights, forming unusually large glaciers to carve the landscape. It also created the jewel of the U.S. national park system: Yellowstone. Meanwhile, forces stretching apart the western U.S. created the mountainous glory of Grand Teton National Park. These two parks, with their majestic mountains, dazzling geysers, and picturesque hot springs, are windows into the Earth's interior, revealing the violent power of the dynamic processes within. Smith and Siegel offer expert guidance through this awe-inspiring terrain, bringing to life the grandeur of these geologic phenomena as they reveal the forces that have shaped--and continue to shape--the greater Yellowstone-Teton region. Over seventy illustrations--including fifty-two in full color--illuminate the breathtaking beauty of the landscape, while two final chapters provide driving tours of the parks to help visitors enjoy and understand the regions wonders. Fascinating and informative, this book affords us a striking new perspective on Earth's creative forces.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert B.

This is the cookbook that shows Americans for the first time what the authentic and original cuisine minceur really is - a whole new approach to cooking originated by the phenomenally talented and successful young French chef who single-handedly decided that fine French food does not have to be fattening. The result is unprecedented: strictly low calorie recipes backed up by the skill, training, and creative imagination of one of the great chefs of our time. Cuisine minceur is built on the classic principles of French cooking. It is an extension of grande cuisine and of the less elaborate nouvelle cuisine with which all the best French chefs are experimenting. But it is far more radical than nouvelle cuisine in its removal of calories - truly a tour de force that in all of France, or anywhere, has been attempted only by Michel Guerard.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>All Time Best Soups</h2><p>&nbsp;A&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;soup&nbsp;recipe&nbsp;is&nbsp;one&nbsp;you&nbsp;make&nbsp;forever--it&nbsp;is&nbsp;comforting,&nbsp;nourishing, the&nbsp;very&nbsp;essence&nbsp;of&nbsp;flavor.&nbsp;In&nbsp;this&nbsp;handsome,&nbsp;focused&nbsp;cookbook,&nbsp;the&nbsp;experts&nbsp;at&nbsp; Cooks Illustrated&nbsp;boil&nbsp;the&nbsp;world&nbsp;of&nbsp;soups&nbsp;down&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;very&nbsp;best&nbsp;choices,&nbsp;each&nbsp;one a&nbsp;kitchen-tested&nbsp;keeper&nbsp;yielding&nbsp;flavors&nbsp;that&nbsp;exceed&nbsp;even&nbsp;what&nbsp;grandma&nbsp;cooked up.&nbsp;Here&nbsp;are&nbsp;the&nbsp;ideal&nbsp;broths,&nbsp;the&nbsp;heartiest&nbsp;rustic&nbsp;soups,&nbsp;most&nbsp;elegant&nbsp;purees,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;best&nbsp;examples&nbsp;from&nbsp;around&nbsp;the&nbsp;world.&nbsp;All-Time Best Soups&nbsp;turns soup-making&nbsp;into&nbsp;an&nbsp;everyday&nbsp;pleasure&nbsp;with&nbsp;recipes&nbsp;guaranteed&nbsp;to&nbsp;become cherished&nbsp;favorites.</p><p>Cook&#x2019;s Illustrated is a widely renowned America&#x2019;s Test Kitchen brand that is the work of over 60 passionate chefs based in Boston, Massachusetts, who put ingredients, cookware, equipment, and recipes through objective, rigorous testing to identify the very best.

When it first appeared in 1982, <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> called it "an extraordinary biography of an extraordinary man," and Timothy Ferris, in <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>, said it was "the biography of Einstein he himself would have liked best," adding that "it is a work against which future scientific biographies will be measured." As a respected physicist himself, Pais was the first biographer to give Einstein's thinking its full due, yet despite the occasional high level of science needed to discuss Einstein's ideas, the book was a national bestseller. Indeed, it was one of <em>The New York Times</em>'s Best Books of the Year, and the winner of the 1983 American Book Award for Science.<br> Now Pais turns to Niels Bohr, to illuminate the life and thought of another giant of 20th-century physics. Bohr was the first to understand how atoms were put together, he played a major role in shaping the theory of the atomic nucleus, he decoded the atomic spectrum of hydrogen, an achievement which marks him as the founder of the quantum dynamics of atoms, and his concept of complementarity (which provides the philosophical underpinning for quantum theory) qualifies him as one of the twentieth century's greatest philosophers. Pais covers all of these achievements with sophistication and clarity, but he also reveals the many other facets of the man. Perhaps most important, he shows that Bohr was not only a great scientist, but also a great nurturer of young scientific talent, acting as father figure extraordinaire for several generations of physicists. Bohr's Institute of Theoretical Physics, which he founded in Copenhagen and for which he tirelessly raised funds, was the world's leading center for physics all through the 1920s and 1930s, the birthplace of Heisenberg's papers on the uncertainty relations, Dirac's first paper on quantum electrodynamics, and other pivotal works. And Pais reveals as well the personal side of Bohr, the avid reader and crossword puzzle solver (Bohr loved Icelandic sagas, Goethe and Schiller, Dickens and Mark Twain--while studying in England early in his career, he improved his English by reading <em>The Pickwick Papers</em> with a dictionary to one side); his aid to Jews and other refugees in the 1930s and during the war; the tragic loss of his son Christian (who died in a sailing accident right before Bohr's eyes); and his attempts during and after the war to promote openness between East and West, meeting with both Roosevelt and Churchill (the former was quite courteous, the latter lectured Bohr like a schoolboy). <br> Bohr's research, his teaching, his friendships with the major scientists of our time, his aid to refugees, his role as philosopher, administrator, and fund raiser, his devotion to science and to his family--all these qualities are illuminated by Pais in a marvelous biography that captures the essence of one of the best-loved figures of this century.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br><strong>Abraham Pais</strong> is Detlev W. Bronk Professor of Physics Emeritus at Rockefeller University in New York. He is also the author of <em>'Subtle is the Lord...'</em> (for which he won an American Book Award) and <em>Inward Bound</em>.<br>Advance praise for Neils Bohr's Times<br><br>'To anyone who worked under Bohr and was influenced by him, the book is fascinating and to any physicist with the slightest interest in the history of his subject it is to be highly recommended. ... the picture of intense argument, and excitement, of great minds seeking the truth and of their<br>strengths and weaknesses comes through vividly, as does the central question - does God play dice? Dr Pais has done a fine job.' Sir Nevill Mott, Nobel Laureate<br><br>'Pais gives us an intimate picture of Niels Bohr, the great human being. He also shows in a profound manner how Bohr's ideas on atomic physics and quantum mechanics evolved, often painfully, and guided most of the scientists working in the field.' Hans A Bethe, Nobel Laureate<br><br>'What struck me most was Pais' account of the intellectual battles that established the basis of modern physical science. We now take the truth of quantum mechanics as read, but it was a great and exciting struggle, and Bohr's finest hour.' Sir Sam Edwards FRS<br><br>'A. Pais' "Niels Bohr's Times" illuminates the probing, deep exertion within Bohr that was midwife to the birth of twentieth century physics. One watches audacious improvisation accompanied by internal doubt of sufficiency and substantiality ... It is a pleasure to catch glimpses of the<br>author's humour abd his personal as well as intellectual impressions; Abraham Pais is very much a part of "Niels Bohr's Times".' Mitchell Feigenbaum<br><br>`Niels Bohr could not have asked for a better biographer than Abraham Pais.' The New York Times Book Review<br><br>`A close-up portrait of a truly extraordinary, and extraordinarily appealing, personality..... Pais is himself a physicist of great distinction. He writes with authority and, in addition, with unfailing grace and considerable charm.' Science<br><br>`Abraham Pais is a physicist who has made fundamental contributions to the quantum picture of reality. But during the last 14 years he has shown himself to be a historian of science who combines deep scientific insight with meticulous scholarship. He is perhaps the unique example in modern<br>times of a world-class physicist turned historian.' London Review of Books<br><br>`For many people, a review of this book will not be needed. Anyone familiar with Abraham Pais's pervious historical/biographical studies of Einstein (Subtle is the Lord) or particle physics (Inward Bound) will already be certain that this book about Bohr is one which must go to the top of the<br>priority list.' The Observatory<br><br>'The book is a delight to read, and Pais gives the layman a glimpse into the make-up of a great man, and also a glimpse into the make-up of the world.'<br>Paul Roberton, Regina Leader Post, 10 October 1992<br><br>'Through a detailed and eminently readable account of Bohr's life and work, his importance to the development of twentieth century physics is established without a doubt ... this very rich book, to which it is impossible to do full justice within the confines of this review. My best advice<br>would be to read it yourself!'<br>A J Kox, European Journal of Physics 1992</p><h2>Comfort Food Shortcuts: An &#34;In the Kitchen with David&#34; Cookbook from QVC&#39;s Resident Foodie</h2><p><b>The beloved host of QVC&#x2019;s <i>In the Kitchen with David </i>is back with a brand-new cookbook featuring 110 comfort food recipes that save on time&#x2014;without skimping on flavor.</b><br><br> Time is the one thing everybody wants&#x2014;and the one thing nobody has enough of.

Helms then recalls his education in Switzerland and Germany and at Williams College; his early career as a foreign correspondent in Berlin, during which he once lunched with Hitler; and his return to newspaper work in the United States. Helms served on the German desk at OSS headquarters in London; subsequently, he was assigned to Allen Dulles&#x2019;s Berlin office in postwar Germany. <br><br>On his return to Washington, Helms assumed responsibility for the OSS carryover operations in Germany, Austria, and Eastern Europe. He remained in this post until the Central Intelligence Agency was formed in 1947. At CIA, Helms served as a division chief; as chief of operations for Frank Wisner; as deputy director for plans (operations); as deputy director; and, ultimately, as director, from 1966 to 1973. He was appointed ambassador to Iran later that year, and he retired from government service in January 1977.<br><br><b>A Look Over My Shoulder</b> focuses on subjects such as intelligence collection, covert action, the uses and misuses of intelligence, and the problems secret intelligence encounters in an open society.

This astute, deeply researched biography sheds a light on Tennessee Williams's warring family, his guilt, his creative triumphs and failures, his sexuality and numerous affairs, his misreported death, even the shenanigans surrounding his estate.</p><p>With vivid cameos of the formative influences in Williams's life&#x2015;his fierce, belittling father Cornelius; his puritanical, domineering mother Edwina; his demented sister Rose, who was lobotomized at the age of thirty-three; his beloved grandfather, the Reverend Walter Dakin&#x2015;<em>Tennessee Williams: Mad Pilgrimage of the Flesh</em> is as much a biography of the man who created <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>, <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>, and <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em> as it is a trenchant exploration of Williams&#x2019;s plays and the tortured process of bringing them to stage and screen.</p><p>The portrait of Williams himself is unforgettable: a virgin until he was twenty-six, he had serial homosexual affairs thereafter as well as long-time, bruising relationships with Pancho Gonzalez and Frank Merlo. With compassion and verve, Lahr explores how Williams's relationships informed his work and how the resulting success brought turmoil to his personal life.</p><p>Lahr captures not just Williams's tempestuous public persona but also his backstage life, where his agent Audrey Wood and the director Elia Kazan play major roles, and Marlon Brando, Anna Magnani, Bette Davis, Maureen Stapleton, Diana Barrymore, and Tallulah Bankhead have scintillating walk-on parts. This is a biography of the highest order: a book about the major American playwright of his time written by the major American drama critic of his time.</p><p>Winner of the 2015 Sheridan Morley Prize for Theatre Biography<br> American Academy of Arts and Letters' Harold D.

This honest guide to childhood shots was written especially for concerned parents. With Dr. Eisenstein's help, it is now possible to make informed vaccine decisions.

Continuing his project of identifying the widespread consequences of monotheism, Stark shows that the Christian conception of God resulted--almost inevitably and for the same reasons--in the Protestant Reformation, the rise of modern science, the European witch-hunts, and the Western abolition of slavery. In the process, he explains why Christian and Islamic images of God yielded such different cultural results, leading Christians but not Muslims to foster science, burn "witches," and denounce slavery.</p><br><p> With his usual clarity and skepticism toward the received wisdom, Stark finds the origins of these disparate phenomena within monotheistic religious organizations. Endemic in such organizations are pressures to maintain religious intensity, which lead to intense conflicts and schisms that have far-reaching social results.</p><br><p> Along the way, Stark debunks many commonly accepted ideas. He interprets the sixteenth-century flowering of science not as a sudden revolution that burst religious barriers, but as the normal, gradual, and direct outgrowth of medieval theology. He also shows that the very ideas about God that sustained the rise of science led also to intense witch-hunting by otherwise clear-headed Europeans, including some celebrated scientists. This conception of God likewise yielded the Christian denunciation of slavery as an abomination--and some of the fiercest witch-hunters were devoted participants in successful abolitionist movements on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><br><br><p> <i>For the Glory of God</i> is an engrossing narrative that accounts for the very different histories of the Christian and Muslim worlds. It fundamentally changes our understanding of religion's role in history and the forces behind much of what we point to as secular progress.</p></p><p><i>For the Glory of God</i> challenges numerous assumptions about how religion affected the course of history. As a professor of Sociology and Comparative Religions at the University of Washington, Rodney Stark (<i>The Rise of Christianity</i>) has a unique ability to write like a chatty social Scientist while delving into complicated theories on religion and history. Here he shows how beliefs in God--whether it was through the filter of Christianity, Judaism, or Islam--provoked and fueled human history. Of course many readers won&#x2019;t dicker with his evidence that religious fervor influenced the witch hunts. But readers may be surprised by Stark&#x2019;s assertion that the persecution of witches actually had more to do with the conflicts between the world&#x2019;s major religions than the oppressive beliefs of fanatical clergy or sexist men. He also asserts that the same religious leaders who were the first to persecute witches were also the first to take a stand against slavery. And, contrary to many historical theories, Stark claims that religion may have been the driving force behind the emergence of modern science. Stark&#x2019;s fascinating conclusions may rile conventional historians. Indeed, Stark was dismayed to discover how many historians "dismiss the role of religion in producing &#x2018;good&#x2019; things such as the rise of science or the end of slavery, and the corresponding efforts to blame religion for practically everything &#x2018;bad.&#x2019;" While certainly weighed in defense of religious beliefs, especially Christianity, Stark offers a respectable and intelligent argument for church leaders, theologians, and maybe a few history buffs to ponder. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p>"I unequivocally recommend this book. Iconoclastic toward the conventional iconoclasts, it is likely to meet with considerable furor."--<b>David Martin, author of <i>Does Christianity Cause War?</i></b></p><p>"This important and brilliant new book makes a number of points desperately needed to be understood by academics, teachers, and lay people. The conventional wisdom on science, religion, witchcraft, slavery, and sects is unfortunately both firmly and falsely fixed. This book will clear up the muddle for anyone open minded enough to learn from it."--<b>Jeffrey Burton Russell, author of <i>A History of Heaven</i></b></p></p><h2>I&#39;ll Sleep When I&#39;m Dead: The Dirty Life and Times of Warren Zevon</h2><p><p>When Warren Zevon died in 2003, he left behind both a fanatical cult following and a rich catalog of dark, witty rock-n-roll classics that includes "Lawyers, Guns, and Money," "Excitable Boy," and the immortal "Werewolves of London." He also left a trove of misadventures and anecdotes, a veritable rock opera of drugs, women, celebrity, high times, and hard ways. As Warren once said, "I got to be Jim Morrison a lot longer than he did."</p><p><em>I'll Sleep When I'm Dead</em> is an intimate and unusual oral history of one of our most original and distinctive rock-and-roll antiheroes. Narrated by his former wife and longtime co-conspirator, Crystal Zevon, the book draws on over eighty interviews with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Stephen King, Billy Bob Thornton, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, and countless others who came under his mischievous spell. The result is a raucous and moving tale of love and obsession, creative genius and epic bad behavior. Told in the words and images of the friends, lovers, and legends who knew him best, <em>I'll Sleep When I'm Dead</em> captures Warren Zevon in all his turbulent glory.</p></p><p><p>Crystal Zevon is Warren Zevon's former wife and lifelong friend. She lives in Vermont near her daughter, son-in-law, and twin grandsons.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> For those who know them, the brilliant, dark songs of Warren Zevon (1947-2003) inspire nothing short of adoration; for those who don't, this stunning biography of the irrepressible rock 'n' roll singer/songwriter should send them sprinting to the nearest record store. By taking an unexpurgated, oral-history approach to Warren's life, his former wife and lifelong friend Crystal has crafted a sharp, funny, jaw-dropping rock biography that's among the best of the sub-genre. Provocative and unflinching, her account distills Warren's journal entries and the author's exhaustive interviews with 87 family members, business associates, band mates, fellow musicians and former lovers into a chronology ranging from Warren's ancestry to his death, at age 56, from lung cancer. The impetus for the book was Warren himself-he implored Crystal to tell his story and to "promise you'll tell 'em the whole truth, even the awful, ugly parts." The awful, ugly parts turn up often: Warren's addictions (to alcohol, drugs and sex), personal demons (intense obsessive-compulsion and commitment-phobia) and paternal shortcomings (to him, kids were nuisances) all get plenty of play here. But so does Warren's music, for which peers like Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen and Paul Schaffer offer plenty of insight. This top-notch biography is a must-read for fans, and a highly rewarding read for anyone interested in a close look at the life of a modern rock icon. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1974 she was highly commended for the Hans Christian Andersen Award and in 1978 <i>Song for a Dark Queen </i>was commended for the Other Award. Rosemary lived for a long time in Arundel, Sussex, with her dogs, and in 1975 she was awarded the OBE for services to Children's Literature.&#34;Told in magnificent, rolling prose&#34; * The Times * &#34;Sutcliff [is] a wonderful writer of historical novels&#34; * Birmingham Post * &#34;The late Sutcliffe&#39;s take on the legend will appeal to both children and adults . . .

He freed six countries from Spanish rule, traveled more than 75,000 miles on horseback to do so, and became the greatest figure in Latin American history. His life is epic, heroic, straight out of Hollywood: he fought battle after battle in punishing terrain, forged uncertain coalitions of competing forces and races, lost his beautiful wife soon after they married and never remarried (although he did have a succession of mistresses, including one who held up the revolution and another who saved his life), and he died relatively young, uncertain whether his achievements would endure. <br><br>Drawing on a wealth of primary documents, novelist and journalist Marie Arana brilliantly captures early nineteenth-century South America and the explosive tensions that helped revolutionize Bol�var. In 1813 he launched a campaign for the independence of Colombia and Venezuela, commencing a dazzling career that would take him across the rugged terrain of South America, from Amazon jungles to the Andes mountains. From his battlefield victories to his ill-fated marriage and legendary love affairs, Bol�var emerges as a man of many facets: fearless general, brilliant strategist, consummate diplomat, passionate abolitionist, gifted writer, and flawed politician. A major work of history, <i>Bol�var </i>colorfully portrays a dramatic life even as it explains the rivalries and complications that bedeviled Bol�var&#x2019;s tragic last days. It is also a stirring declaration of what it means to be a South American.</p><p>Marie Arana was born in Lima, Peru. She is the author of the memoir <i>American Chica</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award; two novels, <i>Cellophane </i>and<i> Lima Nights</i>; and <i>The Writing Life</i>, a collection from her well-known column for <i>The Washington Post</i>. She lives in Washington, DC, and Lima, Peru.Bol�var CHAPTER 1 <p></p> The Road to Bogot�<p></p> <br>We, who are as good as you, make you our lord and master.<br> <br>We trust you to defend our rights and liberties.<br> <br>And if not: No.<br> <br>&#x2014;Coronation ceremony, Spain<br> <br>They heard him before they saw him: the sound of hooves striking the earth, steady as a heartbeat, urgent as a revolution. When he emerged from the sun-dappled forest, they could barely make out the figure on the magnificent horse. He was small, thin. A black cape fluttered about his shoulders.<br> <br>The rebels eyed him with unease. All four had been riding north, fully expecting to come upon a royalist fleeing in the other direction, away from the battle at Boyac�. Three days before, the Spaniards had been surprised by a lightning strike of revolutionaries&#x2014;barefoot, wild-eyed&#x2014;swarming down over the Andes. The Spanish were running now, scattering over the landscape like a herd of frightened deer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here comes one of those losing bastards,&#x201d; said the rebel general. Herm�genes Maza was a veteran of the wars of independence in Spanish America. He had been captured and tortured by royalists, had honed a hunger for revenge. He spurred his horse, rode forward. &#x201c;Halt!&#x201d; he cried out. &#x201c;Who goes there?&#x201d;<br> <br>The rider pressed on at full gallop.<br> <br>General Maza raised his lance and bellowed his warning one more time. But the stranger only advanced, ignoring him. When he got near enough to render his features sharp and unmistakable, he turned coolly to glare at the rebel general. &#x201c;�Soy yo!&#x201d; the man shouted. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a dumb sonofabitch.&#x201d;<br> <br>The general&#x2019;s jaw went slack. He lowered his lance, let the horseman pass.<br> <br>So it was that Sim�n Bol�var rode into Santa Fe de Bogot�, the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada, on the sweltering afternoon of August 10, 1819. He had spent thirty-six days traversing the flooded plains of Venezuela; six days marching over the vertiginous snows of the Andes. By the time he reached the icy pass at thirteen thousand feet called the P�ramo de Pisba, his men were barely alive, scarcely clothed, flogging themselves to revive their failing circulation. He had lost a third of them to frost or starvation, most of his weapons to rust, every last horse to hypothermia. Even so, as he and his scruffy troops staggered down the cliffs, stopping at villages along the way, he had rallied enough fresh recruits and supplies to win a resounding victory that in time would link his name to Napoleon&#x2019;s and Hannibal&#x2019;s. As news of his triumph spread, it quickened the rebels&#x2019; hopes and sent a cold prick of fear through the Spaniards.<br> <br>The capital of the viceroyalty was the first to react. On hearing of Bol�var&#x2019;s advance, agents of the crown abandoned their houses, possessions, businesses. Whole families took flight with little more than the clothes on their back. Maza and his companions could hear the deafening detonations as Spanish soldiers destroyed their own arsenals and hurried for the hills. Even the cruel and ill-tempered viceroy, Juan Jos� de S�mano, disguised as a lowly Indian in a poncho and grimy hat, fled the city in a panic. He knew that Bol�var&#x2019;s retribution would be swift and severe. &#x201c;War to the Death!&#x201d; had been the Liberator&#x2019;s battle cry; after one battle, he had called for the cold-blooded execution of eight hundred Spaniards. S�mano understood that he, too, had been ruthless, ordering the torture and extermination of thousands in the name of the Spanish throne. Reprisals were sure to follow. The king&#x2019;s loyalists flowed out of Santa Fe, as Bogot� was then called, flooding the roads that led south, emptying Santa Fe until its streets were eerily silent and the only residents left were on the side of independence. When Bol�var got word of it, he leapt on his horse, ordered his aides-de-camp to follow, and raced ahead, virtually alone, toward the viceroy&#x2019;s palace.<br> <br>Although Maza had fought under the Liberator years before, he hardly recognized the man passing before him now. He was gaunt, shirtless, his chest bare under the ragged blue jacket. Beneath the worn leather cap, his hair had grown long and grizzled. His skin was rough from wind, bronzed by the sun. His trousers, once a deep scarlet, had faded to a dull pink; his cape, which doubled as a bed, was stained by time and mud.<br> <br>He was thirty-six years old, and, although the disease that would take his life already coiled in his veins, he seemed vibrant and strong, filled with a boundless energy. As he crossed into Santa Fe and made his way down the Calle Real, an old woman rushed toward him. &#x201c;God bless you, phantom!&#x201d; she called, sensing&#x2014;despite his dishevelment&#x2014;a singular greatness. House by house, others ventured out, at first tentatively, and then in a surging human mass that followed him all the way to the plaza. He dismounted in one agile movement and ran up the palace steps.<br> <br>For all his physical slightness&#x2014;five foot six inches and a scant 130 pounds&#x2014;there was an undeniable intensity to the man. His eyes were a piercing black, his gaze unsettling. His forehead was deeply lined, his cheekbones high, his teeth even and white, his smile surprising and radiant. Official portraits relay a less than imposing man: the meager chest, the impossibly thin legs, the hands as small and beautiful as a woman&#x2019;s. But when Bol�var entered a room, his power was palpable. When he spoke, his voice was galvanizing. He had a magnetism that seemed to dwarf sturdier men.<br> <br>He enjoyed good cuisine, but could endure days, even weeks, of punishing hunger. He spent backbreaking days on his horse: his stamina in the saddle was legendary. Even the llaneros, roughriders of the harsh Venezuelan plains, called him, with admiration, Iron Ass. Like those men, he preferred to spend nights in a hammock or wrapped in his cape on bare ground. But he was equally comfortable in a ballroom or at the opera. He was a superb dancer, a spirited conversationalist, a cultivated man of the world who had read widely and could quote Rousseau in French and Julius Caesar in Latin. A widower and sworn bachelor, he was also an insatiable womanizer.<br> <br>By the time Bol�var mounted the stairs to the viceroy&#x2019;s palace on that sultry August day, his name was already known around the world. In Washington, John Quincy Adams and James Monroe agonized over whether their fledgling nation, founded on principles of liberty and freedom, should support his struggle for independence. In London, hard-bitten veterans of England&#x2019;s war against Napoleon signed on to fight for Bol�var&#x2019;s cause. In Italy, the poet Lord Byron named his boat after Bol�var and dreamed of emigrating to Venezuela with his daughter. But there would be five more years of bloodshed before Spain was thrust from Latin American shores. At the end of that savage and chastening war, one man would be credited for single-handedly conceiving, organizing, and leading the liberation of six nations: a population one and a half times that of North America, a landmass the size of modern Europe. The odds against which he fought&#x2014;a formidable, established world power, vast areas of untracked wilderness, the splintered loyalties of many races&#x2014;would have proved daunting for the ablest of generals with strong armies at his command. But Bol�var had never been a soldier. He had no formal military training. Yet, with little more than will and a genius for leadership, he freed much of Spanish America and laid out his dream for a unified continent.<br> <br>Despite all this, he was a highly imperfect man. He could be impulsive, headstrong, filled with contradictions. He spoke eloquently about justice, but wasn&#x2019;t always able to mete it out in the chaos of revolution. His romantic life had a way of spilling into the public realm. He had trouble accepting criticism and had no patience for disagreements. He was singularly incapable of losing gracefully at cards. It is hardly surprising that, over the years, Latin Americans have learned to accept human imperfections in their leaders. Bol�var taught them how.<br> <br>As Bol�var&#x2019;s fame grew, he became known as the George Washington of South America. There were good reasons why. Both came from wealthy and influential families. Both were ardent defenders of freedom. Both were heroic in war, but apprehensive about marshaling the peace. Both resisted efforts to make them kings. Both claimed to want to return to private lives, but were called instead to shape governments. Both were accused of undue ambition.<br> <br>There the similarities end. Bol�var&#x2019;s military action lasted twice as long as Washington&#x2019;s. The territory he covered was seven times as large and spanned an astonishing geographic diversity: from crocodile-infested jungles to the snowcapped reaches of the Andes. Moreover, unlike Washington&#x2019;s war, Bol�var&#x2019;s could not have been won without the aid of black and Indian troops; his success in rallying all races to the patriot cause became a turning point in the war for independence. It is fair to say that he led both a revolution and a civil war.<br> <br>But perhaps what distinguishes these men above all can be seen most clearly in their written work. Washington&#x2019;s words were measured, august, dignified&#x2014;the product of a cautious and deliberate mind. Bol�var&#x2019;s speeches and correspondence, on the other hand, were fiery, passionate. They represent some of the greatest writing in Latin American letters. Although much was produced in haste&#x2014;on battlefields, on the run&#x2014;the prose is at once lyrical and stately, clever but historically grounded, electric yet deeply wise. It is no exaggeration to say that Bol�var&#x2019;s revolution changed the Spanish language, for his words marked the dawn of a new literary age. The old, dusty Castilian of his time, with its ornate flourishes and cumbersome locutions, in his remarkable voice and pen became another language entirely&#x2014;urgent, vibrant, and young.<br> <br>There is yet another important difference. Unlike Washington&#x2019;s glory, Bol�var&#x2019;s did not last unto the grave. In time, the politics in the countries Bol�var created grew ever more fractious, his detractors ever more vehement. Eventually, he came to believe that Latin Americans were not ready for a truly democratic government: abject, ignorant, suspicious, they did not understand how to govern themselves, having been systematically deprived of that experience by their Spanish oppressors. What they needed, in his eyes, was a strong hand, a strict executive. He began making unilateral decisions. He installed a dictator in Venezuela; he announced to Bolivia that it would have a president for life.<br> <br>By the time he was forty-one, his wisdom began to be doubted by functionaries in every republic he had freed and founded. His deputies&#x2014;jealous and wary of his extraordinary power&#x2014;declared they no longer supported his dream of a unified Latin America. Regionalisms emerged, followed by border squabbles, civil wars, and, in Bol�var&#x2019;s own halls, cloak-and-dagger betrayals. Trumped at last, he had no choice but to renounce command. His forty-seventh&#x2014;and final&#x2014;year ended in poverty, illness, and exile. Having given away the sum total of his personal fortune to the revolution, he died a poor and ravaged man. Few heroes in history have been dealt so much honor, so much power&#x2014;and so much ingratitude.<br> <br>But on the afternoon of August 10, 1819, as he stood at the viceroy&#x2019;s splendid desk in the palace in Santa Fe de Bogot�, there was no limit to the possibilities of Bol�var&#x2019;s America. The Spanish despot had left the room in such alarm that he had neglected to take the bag of gold on his table. Indeed, as Bol�var lay claim to the hoard of pesos left behind in the viceregal treasury, he understood that the tide had finally turned: his revolution stood to inherit all the abandoned riches of a waning empire. It would also inherit a whirlwind of political and social chaos. In a matter of a few years, Spain&#x2019;s three-century yoke on the Americas would be sundered and the truly difficult journey toward freedom would begin.<br> <br>THE JOURNEY OF SIM�N BOL�VAR&#x2019;S life began in 1783, a year that was rife with incident. In an otherwise unremarkable building in Paris, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams signed a treaty with the king of England that effectively ended the American Revolution. In the radiant palace of Versailles, an emotionally fragile Marie Antoinette lost the much awaited child she was carrying. In an austere military academy in northeastern France, an adolescent Napoleon was developing a keen interest in war games. In the ancient city of Cuzco, the cousin of T�pac Amaru II led a violent insurrection against the Spanish, for which he was tortured, killed, and dismembered. In a drinking establishment in Manhattan, George Washington ended his command of the Continental Army by bidding a warm farewell to his officers.<br> <br>But in the balmy city of Caracas, walled from the vicissitudes of the Caribbean by a string of green mountains, life was a sleepy affair. On July 24, 1783, as dawn filled the windows of the Bol�var family&#x2019;s stately mansion in the center of the city, the only sound was the serene trickle of drinking water filtering through rock into a pantry jar. Before long, the cock would crow, the horses neigh, and a whole bustling household complete with children and slaves would burst to noisy life as Do�a Mar�a de la Concepci�n Palacios y Blanco went into labor.<br> <br>She was a dark, wavy-haired beauty whose will and fortitude belied her twenty-three years. She had been married at fourteen to Colonel Don Juan Vicente de Bol�var, a tall, self-possessed, blond bachelor thirty-two years older, whose predatory sexual escapades had often landed him before the bishop of Caracas. Both man and wife brought long traditions of wealth and power to their marriage: their elegant manse on San Jacinto Street and the extensive properties they had inherited over the years were a measure of their station in a privileged world. On that summer&#x2019;s day, as they awaited the birth of their fourth child, they owned no fewer than twelve houses in Caracas and the port of La Guaira, a sprawling hacienda in the valley of Aragua, a copper mine, sugar fields, fruit orchards, a rum distillery, a textile business, cacao and indigo plantations, as well as cattle ranches, and hundreds of slaves. They were among the most prosperous families of Venezuela.<br> <br>As Latin American custom has it, in a ritual that goes back five hundred years, no sooner had word of Do�a Concepci�n&#x2019;s labor spread from the servants to the neighbors than friends began to gather in the house&#x2019;s parlor to await the birth. By the time the child was born that night, a festive crowd of well-wishers was toasting his health, among them the bishop, the judge, the velvet-sleeved patriarchs of Caracas&#x2019;s old families, and a rich priest who would baptize the boy and, within a matter of months, bequeath him a fortune. They stood in the great room, resting their elbows on ponderous carved mahogany chests and tables. The chairs were covered in dark upholstery; the mirrors heavy with decoration; the damask curtains a deep, gleaming purple, crowned with cornices of burnished gold. The servants offered refreshments from trays an...</p><h2>The Uncommon Reader</h2><p>Dust jacket and book very good.

Or, more to the point,&#x2019; and she took up her soup spoon, &#x2018;was he as good?&#x2019;<br>Unbriefed on the subject of the glabrous <br>playwright and novelist, the president looked wildly about for his minister of culture. But she was being addressed by the Archbishop of Can-terbury.<br>&#x2018;Jean Genet,&#x2019; said the Queen again, helpfully. &#x2018;Vous le connaissez?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Bien s�r,&#x2019; said the president.<br>&#x2018;Il m&#x2019;int�resse,&#x2019; said the Queen.<br>&#x2018;Vraiment?&#x2019; The president put down his spoon. It was going to be a long evening.<br>It was the dogs&#x2019; fault. They were snobs and ordinarily, having been in the garden, would have gone up the front steps, where a footman generally opened them the door.<br>Today, though, for some reason they careered along the terrace, barking their heads off, and scampered down the steps again and round the end along the side of the house, where she could hear them yapping at something in one of the yards.<br>It was the City of Westminster travelling library, a large removal-like van parked next to the bins outside one of the kitchen doors. This wasn&#x2019;t a part of the palace she saw much of, and she had certainly never seen the library parked there before, nor presumably had the dogs, hence the din, so having failed in her attempt to calm them down she went up the little steps of the van in order to apologise.<br>The driver was sitting with his back to her, sticking a label on a book, the only seeming borrower a thin ginger-haired boy in white overalls crouched in the aisle reading. Neither of them took any notice of the new arrival, so she coughed and said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry about this awful racket,&#x2019; where-upon the driver got up so suddenly he banged his head on the Reference section and the boy in the aisle scrambled to his feet and upset Photography &amp; Fashion.<br>She put her head out of the door. &#x2018;Shut up this minute, you silly creatures,&#x2019; which, as had been the move&#x2019;s intention, gave the driver/librarian time to compose himself and the boy to pick up the books.<br>&#x2018;One has never seen you here before, Mr . . .&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Hutchings, Your Majesty. Every Wednesday, ma&#x2019;am.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Really? I never knew that. Have you come far?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Only from Westminster, ma&#x2019;am.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;And you are . . . ?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Norman, ma&#x2019;am. Seakins.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;And where do you work?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;In the kitchens, ma&#x2019;am.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Oh. Do you have much time for reading?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Not really, ma&#x2019;am.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m the same. Though now that one is here I suppose one ought to borrow a book.&#x2019;<br>Mr Hutchings smiled helpfully.<br>&#x2018;Is there anything you would recommend?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;What does Your Majesty like?&#x2019;<br>The Queen hesitated, because to tell the truth she wasn&#x2019;t sure. She&#x2019;d never taken much interest in reading. She read, of course, as one did, but liking books was something she left to other people. It was a hobby and it was in the nature of her job that she didn&#x2019;t have hobbies. Jogging, growing roses, chess or rock climbing, cake decoration, model aeroplanes. No. Hobbies involved preferences and preferences had to be avoided; pref-<br>erences excluded people. One had no preferences. Her job was to take an interest, not to be interested herself. And besides, reading wasn&#x2019;t doing. She was a doer. So she gazed round the book-lined van and played for time. &#x2018;Is one allowed to borrow a book? One doesn&#x2019;t have a ticket?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;No problem,&#x2019; said Mr Hutchings.<br>&#x2018;One is a pensioner,&#x2019; said the Queen, not that she was sure that made any difference.<br>&#x2018;Ma&#x2019;am can borrow up to six books.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Six? Heavens!&#x2019;<br>Meanwhile the ginger-haired young man had made his choice and given his book to the librarian to stamp. Still playing for time, the Queen picked it up.<br>&#x2018;What have you chosen, Mr Seakins?&#x2019; expecting it to be, well, she wasn&#x2019;t sure what she expected, but it wasn&#x2019;t what it was. &#x2018;Oh. Cecil Beaton. Did you know him?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;No, ma&#x2019;am.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;No, of course not. You&#x2019;d be too young. He always used to be round here, snapping away. And a bit of a tartar. Stand here, stand there. Snap, snap. And there&#x2019;s a book about him now?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Several, ma&#x2019;am.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Really? I suppose everyone gets written about sooner or later.&#x2019;<br>She riffled through it. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s probably a picture of me in it somewhere. Oh yes. That one. <br>Of course, he wasn&#x2019;t just a photographer. He designed, too. Oklahoma!, things like that.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I think it was My Fair Lady, ma&#x2019;am.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Oh, was it?&#x2019; said the Queen, unused to being contradicted. &#x2018;Where did you say you worked?&#x2019; She put the book back in the boy&#x2019;s big red hands.<br>&#x2018;In the kitchens, ma&#x2019;am.&#x2019;<br>She had still not solved her problem, knowing that if she left without a book it would seem to Mr Hutchings that the library was somehow lacking. Then on a shelf of rather worn-looking <br>volumes she saw a name she remembered. &#x2018;Ivy Compton-Burnett! I can read that.&#x2019; She took the book out and gave it to Mr Hutchings to stamp.<br>&#x2018;What a treat!&#x2019; she hugged it unconvincingly before opening it. &#x2018;Oh. The last time it was taken out was in 1989.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s not a popular author, ma&#x2019;am.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Why, I wonder? I made her a dame.&#x2019;<br>Mr Hutchings refrained from saying that this wasn&#x2019;t necessarily the road to the public&#x2019;s heart.<br>The Queen looked at the photograph on the back of the jacket. &#x2018;Yes. I remember that hair, a roll like a pie-crust that went right round her head.&#x2019; She smiled and Mr Hutchings knew that the visit was over. &#x2018;Goodbye.&#x2019;<br>He inclined his head as they had told him at the library to do should this eventuality ever arise, and the Queen went off in the direction of the garden with the dogs madly barking again, while Norman, bearing his Cecil Beaton, skirted a chef lounging outside by the bins having a cigarette and went back to the kitchens.<br>Shutting up the van and driving away, Mr Hutchings reflected that a novel by Ivy Compton-Burnett would take some reading. He had never got very far with her himself and thought, rightly, that borrowing the book had just been a polite gesture. Still, it was one that he appreciated and <br>as more than a courtesy. The council was always threatening to cut back on the library, and the patronage of so distinguished a borrower (or customer, as the council preferred to call it) would do him no harm.<br>&#x2018;We have a travelling library,&#x2019; the Queen said to her husband that evening. &#x2018;Comes every Wednesday.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Jolly good. Wonders never cease.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You remember Oklahoma!?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Yes.

What will that room be? Will it serve a need that you were not aware of when you first moved in? You might, for instance, have decided that you now need a study or an exercise room. Or will it allow you to elaborate on something that has always been part of your life? Perhaps you have always cared about books and have bookshelves spread throughout your home, but now you want to gather those books together in a room you will call the library. You may not have had a room where a guest could stay but now want to offer hospitality to a married son or daughter with a new generation of children (will one room be enough?). You may want to take an avocation, like wood carving or work you have done for a cause you cared about, and develop it, so the new room will be a studio or an office. You may have become passionate about gourmet cooking and want a different kind of kitchen. Or you may simply want to use this opportunity to extend your traditional &#x201c;living room&#x201d; in some new and more inclusive way, with more space or wider windows or a hearth.<br><br>The first thing you will discover when you &#x201c;add&#x201d; a room to a house is that add is generally the wrong word, because the way you use all the rest of the house, the way you live and organize your time and even your relationships, will be affected by the change. Existing rooms will be used differently, sounds will echo in new ways, community and privacy will have new meanings. Gaps will open where familiar items have been shifted to the new space and new acquisitions will fill them. The new room is not simply tacked on to the east or west side of the house, it represents a new configuration of the entire building and the lives it shelters.<br><br>This is what longevity is like. In the United States, we have not &#x201c;added&#x201d; years to life (thirty in the twentieth century, twenty since World War II), tacked on at the end. We have changed the shape and meaning of a lifetime in ways we do not yet fully understand. Similarly, with increasing numbers of older citizens, we are changing as a population, becoming a rather different society, just as the Louisiana and Alaska purchases brought more than geographical space to the nation. Arguably, something even more profound has happened: we are evolving into a rather different species, inhabiting a new niche and challenged to adapt in new ways. Similar processes are occurring in other industrialized countries, but culture, legislation, and economy make them play out differently, so the examples in this book, drawn from the United States, need to be interpreted in the light of American conditions, particularly the continuing openness to immigration, the lack of mandatory retirement laws, and attitudes toward employment.<br><br>Here is the situation in which we find ourselves. Most Americans are aware that the retirement of the Baby Boom generation is creating a variety of new demands, so that &#x201c;retirement&#x201d; has changed its meaning. In fact, our assumptions about retirement already mask deep changes. Government retirement pensions were invented in Germany at the beginning of the twentieth century, at a time when sixty-five-year-olds were few and far between (life expectancy at birth was about forty-five), were mostly very limited in their ability to work, and would not be around for long. In other words, retirement was invented for people whose conditions were in some ways worse than those of eighty-five-year-olds in the United States today. Today&#x2019;s sixty-five-year-olds are starting new careers or continuing old ones, traveling around the world, and eloping with new loves.<br><br>What is less widely understood is that this is happening at a time when both individual life cycles and populations have taken on radically new structures. We have not added decades to life expectancy by simply extending old age; instead, we have opened up a new space partway through the life course, a second and different kind of adulthood that precedes old age, and as a result every stage of life is undergoing change.<br><br>Different societies look at age-groups differently. In some places status is governed by small differences of age, in others all children or all old people may be grouped together. However, virtually every society does make distinctions between children and adults and does recognize changes in the participation of older adults, creating at least three major stages of life, which may be subdivided further, stages that ? cor?respond for many individuals to generations: childhood (not yet adults), parenthood (adults), and grandparenthood (elders). With the survival of many grandparents to become great-grandparents and the improved health conditions of older adults, we have in effect created the first four-generation society in history.<br><br>Here I am not using the term <i>generation</i> to refer to twenty-year cohorts with catchy nicknames, although cohorts do indeed share characteristics determined by the changing contexts in which they have grown up and lived. I am referring to the presence of three coexisting generations defined by their roles and activities, with individuals moving from one to the next as &#x201c;the younger generation&#x201d; becomes &#x201c;the older generation&#x201d; around the campfire or the table; children become parents, and parents become grandparents, often by about the age of forty, which was regarded as a fairly ripe old age through most of human history. Today&#x2019;s grandparents, including a considerable proportion of Baby Boomers, are different from grandparents in the past and much healthier and more numerous.<br><br>This is new. Every society has some members who are not yet full participants&#x2014;infants, children, and those approaching adulthood, whom we now call adolescents. And every society has adults who are simultaneously full participants in maintaining the society and in its perpetuation as they produce and rear children. And every society has at least a few older members who are past their reproductive and child-rearing years, often in declining health. This older generation typically withdraws from some kinds of participation, but the pattern always includes some continuing contribution, often of a sort that is not open to younger adults.<br><br>We know from cross-cultural studies that postreproductive adults&#x2014;elders&#x2014;have played a key role in human societies through time. Many of these elders have been grandparents and a few have been great-grandparents (a very scarce resource through most of history), but in terms of the ancient three-generation structure, they have played similar roles. This has been the human pattern: three generations or stages of life, diverse and changing through time, defined in relation to the others and to their forms of participation and only secondarily as age-groups.<br><br>Now, however, older adults, many of whom are grandparents but who have an unprecedented level of health and energy, time and resources, fit into society in new ways, often much like younger adults. And for the first time in history there are large numbers of great- grandparents, who look and act somewhat, but not precisely, the way grandparents used to. Biomedicine has once again created a profound change in the human condition. We have inserted a new developmental stage into the life cycle, a second stage of adulthood, not an extension tacked on to old age.<br><br>A decade ago some of us began calling this stage a second adulthood, but that phrase too easily evokes the second rate or secondhand&#x2014;or even a second childhood of incompetence. I think we will need to think in terms of a first adult stage we can call Adulthood I, a very busy and productive time, which includes both our primary child-rearing years and the building of careers, and a new stage we can call Adulthood II. Adulthood II may begin as early as age forty (for example, for athletes, whose first careers may last only twenty years) and extend past eighty (for example, for politicians, if they reach the Senate, and many self-employed people), for many years of participation and contribution. Both as individuals and as a society we are being taken by surprise by this change, yet so far most of the discussion focuses on its financial implications, not on its opportunities. How will the new room be used? How will the rest of life be different?<br><br>Those who are grandparents today are unlike the grandparents they remember. They adore their grandchildren, but they just aren&#x2019;t sitting still. They won&#x2019;t behave like stereotypical grandparents, with long memories and short walks, until they are great-grandparents. They are often colleagues to their own children, working side by side as adults. Historically, wisdom has been associated with elders. Today&#x2019;s grandparents combine the same length of experience with continuing mobility, so I think of Adulthood II as the stage of active wisdom, which precedes old age.<br><br>We are going through a profound change in the status of the human species. The easiest way to assess that change is to consider the importance of an extended childhood in the process of becoming human, <i>Homo sapiens</i>. From very simple organisms up through mammals, learning very slowly became a key to survival; most organisms are hatched or born equipped with the specialized behaviors they need to survive in their environments, or can acquire them in a matter of days or weeks, without an extended period of dependency. Human development, by comparison, is exceptionally labor intensive, requiring the attention of multiple adults over long periods of time. Even in comparison to other mammals, human infants and children are helpless in a way that is conspicuous and seems terribly inefficient. But it is this helplessness that is the key not only to the flexibility that has allowed humans to adapt to every environment on the planet but also to the long adventure of exploration and invention that we call culture.

After the Reys escaped Paris by bicycle in 1940 carrying the manuscript for the original&nbsp;<i>Curious George</i>, the book was published in America in 1941. More than 200 Curious George titles followed, with 75 million books sold&nbsp;worldwide. Curious George has been successfully adapted into a major motion picture and an Emmy-winning television show on&nbsp;PBS.<br> &nbsp;</p>PreSchool-Grade 3-It's time for one of George's favorite events, the annual pancake breakfast fundraiser for the children's hospital. When George begins adding blueberries to the pancakes, the line becomes so long that the man making the pancakes has to go for more help. When the man discovers that a monkey is making his pancakes, George leads him on an action filled romp through the event, ending with George raising so much money at the dunk tank that he is given the honor of presenting the money to the president of the hospital. Reader Joe Fox captures all of the precociousness that is Curious George, while adopting a variety of voices to give life to the various characters George encounters. Sounds such as the chirping of birds and the mumbling of crowds create an outdoor ambiance that nicely enhances the story. The background music, driven by saxophone and keyboards, is meant to underscore the activity, but many times almost overwhelms the story. Younger children may have difficulty discerning the page-turn signal from the music. A nice feature before the story begins is the narrator telling readers what page to begin on by describing the illustration on that page. A fine addition to collections for primary graders.<br><i>Veronica Schwartz, Des Plaines Public Library, IL</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Power of Intention: Learning to Co-create Your World Your Way</h2><p>Intention is generally viewed as a certain kind of determination propelling one to succeed at all costs by never giving up on an inner picture. In this view, an attitude that combines hard work with an indefatigable drive toward excellence is the way to succeed. However, intention is viewed very differently in this book. Dr. Wayne W. Dyer has researched intention as a force in the universe that allows the act of creation to take place. This book explores intention&#x2014; as something you do&#x2014; as an energy you&#x2019;re a part of. We&#x2019;re all intended here through the invisible power of intention. This is the first book to look at intention as a field of energy that you can access to begin co-creating your life with the power of intention. Part I deals with the principles of intention, offering true stories and examples on ways to make the connection. Dr. Dyer identifies the attributes of the all-creating universal mind of intention as creative, kind, loving, beautiful, expanding, endlessly abundant, and receptive, explaining the importance of emulating this source of creativity. In Part II, Dr. Dyer offers an intention guide with specific ways to apply the co-creating principles in daily life. Part III is an exhilarating description of Dr. Dyer&#x2019;s vision of a world in harmony with the universal mind of intention.</p><p>After years of spiritual study and reflection, inspirational speaker and bestselling author Wayne Dyer has emerged a highly esteemed teacher. His current message about tapping into the power of intention may sound like good old positive thinking: just stay focused on what you want, rather than focusing on the lack of having what you want. But the teaching here goes deeper than just controlling thoughts (although he does acknowledge that thought control is a surprisingly challenging and significant endeavor). This book might help readers land a better job, but it's more relevant for those who are ready to detach from an ego-driven life filled with quick fixes of happiness and step into a more authentic, joyful, and spiritually fulfilling life. His core teachings speak to tapping into a universal source of energy that can also be called the "power of intention." He calls people who are consciously co-creating with this energy source "connectors" and describes them as "individuals who have made themselves available for success...They don't say <i>With my luck things won't work out.</i> Instead, you&#x2019;re more likely to hear something like, <i>I intend to create this and I know it will work out</i>." Connectors are also committed to Dyer's "seven faces of intention"--creativity, kindness, love, beauty, expansion, abundance and receptivity, which he speaks to throughout the book. Each chapter concludes with five suggestions for becoming stronger connectors, such as how to monitor one's inner speech or shift out of low-energy beliefs. Some criticize Dyer for not giving credit to other teachers who offer this same message, especially Jerry and Esther Hicks (<i>A New Beginning I</i>) and even Ralph Waldo Emerson. It's impossible to know whether this was a deliberate omission, but it is obvious that Dyer has tapped into a growing conversation about co-creating with "source." Other leading-edge voices in this conversation include Eckhart Tolle (<i>The Power of Now</i>), Shakti Gawain (<i>Creative Visualization</i> ) and Lynn Grabhorn (<i>Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting</i>). --<i>Gail Hudson</i>$500K advertising budget!

Their journey through a land abandoned by the future leads Nair, Adriko, and Davidia to meet themselves not in a new light, but rather in a new darkness.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, November 2014:</strong> In this slim, fiery, full-speed-ahead novel, National Book Award winner Denis Johnson has created two of the more memorable characters I&#x2019;ve read this year. Roland Nair and Michael Adriko are soldiers, spies, friends, liars. They&#x2019;ve fought side by side, witnessed torture and death. They also once made stacks of illicit cash (diamonds), and now Michael has an outrageous plan to make more (uranium - maybe). Years after they last parted, they reunite in Freetown, Sierra Leone, with Michael&#x2019;s innocent and stunning fianc� along for the adventure. Uncowed by the madness and deceptions swirling around them all, Michael is an absolutely shimmering fictional creation -- both an elegant trained killer, and a lovable man-child. He&#x2019;s full of secrets (&#x201c;more will be revealed&#x201d; is a verbal tic) and dark wisdom (&#x201c;people don&#x2019;t quite understand - to be eaten pays a compliment to your power&#x201d;). He&#x2019;s also lustful, greedy, tormented, violent and, incongruously, hopeful and hilarious. What Michael really wants is love, and family -- the home he&#x2019;s never had. As he drags his friend and fianc� deeper into West Africa, in a desperate search for his long-lost village, we root for Michael, even as this irresistible and infuriating child of war barrels exuberantly toward darkness. In a murky post-9/11 world, Johnson seems to be saying, trust and friendship are what we make them. <i>&#x2013;Neal Thompson</i></p><b>Denis Johnson (1949-2017)</b> is the author of eight novels, one novella, one book of short stories, three collections of poetry, two collections of plays, and one book of reportage.

Granted unmatched access by Ammon Bundy to the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Pogue met ranchers and militiamen ready to die fighting the federal government.</p><p>He witnessed the fallout of communities riven by politics and the danger (and allure) of uncompromising religious belief. The occupation ended in the shooting death of one rancher, the imprisonment of dozens more, and a firestorm over the role of government that engulfed national headlines. </p><p>In a raw and restless narrative that roams the same wild terrain as his literary forebears Edward Abbey and Hunter S. Thompson, Pogue's <i>Chosen Country</i> examines the underpinnings of this rural uprising and struggles to reconcile diverging ideas of freedom, tracing a cultural fault line that spans the nation.</p></p><p><b>James Pogue</b> has written for <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>Granta</i>, the <i>New Republic</i>, and <i>Vice</i>, where he is a contributing editor.

Embedded in the standoff as it unfolded, Pogue straddles a fine ethical line between maintaining friendships with the participants while reporting for the <i>New York Times</i>. But his disarmingly casual tone masks a deeply thoughtful analysis of the movement&#x2019;s historical antecedents and its messianic Mormon roots. Chronicling with empathy the widespread rural powerlessness and alienation that gave rise to the Bundy family, Pogue never loses sight of the movement&#x2019;s devotion to its own victimhood. He is particularly effective in revealing the cult of personality that built up around Ammon Bundy, who sees angels directing his actions and lets others take the fall for his grandiosity.

The imaginative charm that has made Pooh the world&#x2019;s most famous bear pervades the pages of Milne&#x2019;s poetry, and Ernest H. Shepard&#x2019;s witty and loving illustrations enhance these truly delightful gift editions.</p><p>In all likelihood, your mother or father read you these poems and remember their parents reading the same. This collection of poetry by the creator of Winnie the Pooh was first published in 1924. With its companion volume <i>Now We Are Six,</i> the little books became two of the biggest bestsellers in publishing history. Children all over the world have heard about changing the guard at Buckingham Palace; James James Morrison Morrison Weather by George Dupree; the three little foxes who kept their handkerchiefs in cardboard boxes; and, of course, Christopher Robin, named for A.A. Milne's son. Adults and older children will enjoy Milne's poems too, as some of his humor is subtly directed at a more sophisticated audience. But younger children are the ones who love the naughty Mary Jane (lovely rice pudding again?) and the bears on the corners of London's streets. Read these poems aloud and pass along (or start) a family tradition. <i>(Ages 5 to 9)</i><i>When We Were Very Young</i>, the first of A.A. Milne?s four world-famous books for children, introduced Christopher Robin to innumerable friends, and has probably been read more widely than any other book of verse for children published in our time. <br> <br>For sheer delightfulness the children?s rhymes of A.A. Milne are in a class by themselves, with their charm, humour, and understanding ? to say nothing of their irresistible rhythms. <br> <br>Ernest H. Shepard?s illustrations are an important complement to the verses. A.A. Milne has here created a book of proven classic quality, a book that goes straight to the heart.</p><h2>Just Give Me Jesus</h2><p><p>After two pressure-filled, life-changing years of professional exhaustion and personal turmoil, Anne Graham Lotz found herself with only one heart-cry, "Please, just give me Jesus." In this faith-inspiring book, she stares intently at the realities of life with her Savior. To those needing a fresh start, to those still searching for happiness, to those in need of forgiveness, to the suffering and the self-righteous alike, Jesus was, is, and will always be the answer.</p></p><p><p>Anne Graham Lotz is a bestselling and award-winning author of eleven books, including <em>Wounded by God&#x2019;s People. </em>She is the president of AnGeL Ministries, Raleigh, North Carolina. Called &#x201c;the best preacher in the family&#x201d; by her father, Billy Graham, Anne speaks around the globe with the wisdom and authority of years spent studying God's Word. The <em>New York Times</em> named Anne one of the five most influential evangelists of her generation.</p><br> CHAPTER ONE: Jesus Makes God Visible . . .<br> To Me <i>John 1:1&#x2013;9</i> <br> <b>Y</b>ears ago my mother was invited to a very prestigious dinner party in London, England. The glittering affair included members of the royal family as well as other aristocrats and leaders from British society. The dinner, softened by candlelight, with the tinkle of silver and the sparkle of crystal accompanying the sounds of accented conversation, had an ambiance of elegance. <p>The occasion might have been intimidating for someone unaccustomed to such a setting, but my mother was as at ease as a queen holding court. Dressed in a simple black gown with a triple strand of pearls around her neck, she looked stylish and sophisticated. Heads turned as people whispered their curious inquiries about who she might be. </p><p>But my mother was so interested in the other guests at her table she was oblivious to the small stir she had created. Her expression was not the duly bored, arrogant look adopted by many of the socially elite. Nor were her words stilted and self-conscious. Instead, her eyes danced with the joy of life, and her conversation was lively and peppered with questions as she sought to draw the others at her table into a discussion. </p><p>As she conversed, Mother discovered that the distinguished-looking older gentleman seated beside her was the former head of Scotland Yard, Great Britain&#x2019;s equivalent of the FBI. Fascinated, she respectfully began to probe him for anecdotes. As he opened up under her genuine interest, he revealed that the departments under his authority had included those for forgery and counterfeiting. When she surmised that he must have spent a lot of time studying counterfeit signatures, he corrected her. "On the contrary, Mrs. Graham. I spent all of my time studying the genuine thing. That way, when I saw a counterfeit, I could immediately detect it." </p><p>Today, our world is cluttered with lies, deceit, hypocrisy, and fraud at almost every level. From government leaders to salesclerks &nbsp; to airline ticket agents to restaurant ma�tre d&#x2019;s &nbsp; to business associates to secretaries &nbsp; to friends to neighbors &nbsp; to advertisers, <br> everyone seems to play loose with the truth. </p><p>This "whatever works is right" attitude has even crept into the Christian community. Too often, we focus on methods instead of missions, programs instead of prayer, organization instead of inspiration, pragmatism instead of power. Many preachers preach to be popular, instead of preaching to change lives. Their sermons are 95 percent their own thoughts and 5 percent God&#x2019;s truth. And the average church member <i>cannot tell the difference</i> because he or she is biblically illiterate! </p><p>Sadly, this also tends to twist our perception of Who Jesus is. While some have softened and sentimentalized Him until He is barely recognizable, others have distorted and doubted Him until He is undesirable. </p><p>My mother&#x2019;s dinner partner had unwittingly touched on a very important principle. If you and I want to be able to detect counterfeit Christs and counterfeit truth, we need to immerse ourselves in the real thing. We need to saturate ourselves in the truth of the Word of God. This applies to our faith in general, as well as to our understanding of Jesus. </p><p><i>Who is Jesus? </i>He lived two thousand years ago, in an obscure town, in an obscure country, during a relatively dark period in human history that was dominated by the Roman Empire. Yet He stands unequaled and unparalleled in the phenomenal greatness of His life as well as in the stunning impact He has had on history. </p><p>As we turn the corner into a new millennium and gaze back at the last two thousand years, a handful of individuals seem to rise up from our history pages&#x2014;individuals whose lives or words or accomplishments impacted the entire human race, for good or for bad. Names like Julius Caesar, Martin Luther, Muhammad, Christopher Columbus, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Adolf Hitler, Alexander Graham Bell, Jonas Salk, Joseph Stalin, Mahatma Gandhi, Mao Tse-tung, and David Ben-Gurion come readily to mind. Yet I would heartily agree with Reynolds Price, who in the introduction to his <i>Time</i> magazine cover story on Jesus, wrote, "It would require much exotic calculation . . . to deny that the single most powerful figure&#x2014;not merely in these two millenniums but in all human history&#x2014;has been Jesus of Nazareth." Even today&#x2019;s date is based on the calculation of the date of His birth. </p><p>So <i>Who is Jesus? What is there about Him </i>that makes Him <i>so compelling </i>that . . . . . . a Yugoslavian nun would give her life to comfort the dying in Calcutta for His sake? <br> . . . some of the greatest architectural achievements in Europe were built for worship of Him? <br> . . . some of the world&#x2019;s most beautiful art was created to honor Him? <br> . . . some of the world&#x2019;s most glorious music was written to praise Him? <br> . . . 167 years after Rome crucified Him, He was acknowledged as the only God in the Roman Empire? <br> . . . Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, rotting in a Siberian work camp, said the very thought of Him was enough to keep his sanity? <br> . . . in an outburst of physical pain, frustration, anger, or just disagreement with the officials at a ball game, His Name&#x2014;not Buddha&#x2019;s or Muhammad&#x2019;s&#x2014;is used in cursing? <br> . . . two thousand years after He has been physically removed from the world, people from all walks of life say He has saved them from drugs, illness, suicide, depression, and hopelessness? <br> . . . in His Name, people forsake personal gain to feed the hungry, house the homeless, clothe the naked, heal the sick? Who is Jesus? How can we know who He <i>really</i> is? We know by studying the truth. The only legitimate source of historical information on His life is found in the four New Testament Gospels. This book, <i>Just Give Me Jesus</i>, focuses on the fourth Gospel, written by John, who witnessed firsthand the events he recorded. And John&#x2019;s Gospel is the truth. </p><p>So <i>who is Jesus</i>? Decide the answer for yourself as you read the apostle John&#x2019;s clear, confident, certain, and compelling biography. His stirring account begins by leaving no doubt that Jesus makes God visible to all, because Jesus is God as Man.&nbsp; <br> Jesus is Bigger Than I Think John&#x2019;s Gospel begins with a verbal trumpet flourish: "In the beginning was the Word" (John 1:1). These words immediately take us back to the vastness of eternity before there was anything at all. They also take us back to Genesis, where God began to reveal Himself to all mankind. In Genesis, the Bible itself opens with the exact same phrase, "In the beginning . . . ," as it introduces perhaps the most dramatic chapter of the entire Book.<b> </b>As the passage unfolds the mysteries of creation, the phrase "And God said" is repeated no fewer than ten times in the first chapter.<b> </b>The phrase shows God&#x2019;s awesome creative power as He spoke into existence everything that is or ever has been or ever will be. We might assume that the "word" He spoke, the "word" by which He called everything into being, was a <i>language</i> of some sort with nouns and verbs and pronouns and adverbs conveying His will to empty space. </p><p>Not so! John stuns us in the very first verse of his Gospel, which reveals, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word <i>was</i> God. <i>He</i> was with God in the beginning" (John 1:1&#x2013;2; emphasis added). How awesome that the "Word" that was in the beginning, by which and through which God created everything, was&#x2014;and is&#x2014; a living Person with a mind, will, emotions, and intellect. He Is Eternal The Gospel of John states this living Person was not <i>from</i> the beginning, but that <i>in</i> the beginning of time, space, the universe, eternity, and history, He was already there! He is eternal! </p><p>John&#x2019;s choice of wording in the Greek language makes his opening declaration astounding. His Greek for "Word," which he emphasized by repeating three times in the first verse, is <i>logos</i>, the outward expression of the mind and will that rules the universe. Plato, whose writings were popular in John&#x2019;s day, had said he hoped that someday a "logos" might come forth from God that would make everything about life clear. John, who had perhaps read Plato, began his Gospel by stating in Greek that a "logos" <i>had come </i>from God. And not just a "logos" but the "<i>Living</i> Logos"&#x2014;an outward revelation of the heart and mind of God expressed perfectly for us in a living Person. </p><p>As we meditate on John&#x2019;s words, our sense of awe increases when we realize that "out of the . . . heart, the mouth speaks."<b> </b>So our conclusion is that the Logos who was in the beginning with God is a living Person . . . but He is more. He is the living expression of what is on God&#x2019;s mind. But <i>He is more</i>. He is the living expression of what is on God&#x2019;s heart. But He is even more. He is the very heart of the Almighty God of the universe laid bare for all to see! </p><p>Do you want to know what is on the mind of God? <i>Then look at Jesus! </i>Do you want to know the will of God? Then look at Jesus! Do you want to know what is in the heart of God? Then look at Jesus! Jesus is the exact revelation of what is on the mind and heart and in the will of God! </p><p>Jesus makes God visible. But that truth does not make Him somehow less than God. He is equally supreme with God. He Is Equal Each word John used, including the prepositions, becomes weighty with treasured truth: "He was <i>with</i> God in the beginning." Because you really can&#x2019;t be <i>with</i> yourself, John implies there were two People, two separate supreme Beings Who are equal in power, activity, personality, and intelligence in a face-to-face, eye-to-eye existence. One was not more and One was not less. They were and are equally supreme, sharing the glory and splendor of heaven&#x2019;s throne, because "the Word was <i>God</i>." </p><p>What a wondrous mystery! Our God is one God, yet at the same time He is more than one. Throughout the ages people have engaged in an intellectual wrestling match with this astounding truth. But those who do so miss the blessing that comes from simply worshiping an infinite God Who is beyond our finite understanding. He Is Enduringly the Same As John continued his trumpet flourish, we learn that Jesus, the Living Logos, is enduringly the same today as He always has been: "The same was in the beginning with God" (John 1:2 kjv). There was no personality change in this Person from the beginning of time until John&#x2019;s day to our day to the last day of human history on into eternity. </p><p>The One Who spoke all things into existence and then transformed Planet Earth from a formless, empty, dark, water-submerged blob dangling in space to a beautiful place that reflected His own image is the same Person Who has power today to transform your life and mine. </p><p>The One Who offered all men salvation from the storm of His judgment if they would come into the ark is the same Person today Who offers salvation from His judgment if we would come into Him at the cross. </p><p>The One Who called Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees, promising to fully bless him if he would follow Him in a life of faith is the same Person Who today calls us out of the world and promises to bless us if we follow Him in a life of faith. </p><p>The One Who delivered His children from bondage to slavery in Egypt with a titanic display of power is the same Person Who was crucified then rose from the dead to deliver His children today from bondage to sin. </p><p>The One Who halted the entire invasion of Canaan by the Israelites while He extended His grace to one Canaanite prostitute is the same Person today Who stops to care for and extend His grace to sinners. </p><p>The One Who elevated David from a shepherd boy to a shepherd king is the same Person today Who places His people in positions of leadership, honor, and authority. </p><p>The One Who answered Elijah&#x2019;s prayer and sent down the fire to consume the sacrifice on Mount Carmel and then sent down the rain to end the three-year drought in Israel is the same Person today Who hears and answers prayer. <i>Do you know Him?</i> If Adam knew Him as a beloved Father, <br> if Eve knew Him as the original Homemaker, <br> if Noah knew Him as the Refuge from the storm, <br> if Abraham knew Him as a Friend, <br> if Moses knew Him as the Redeemer, <br> if Rahab knew Him as the gracious Savior, <br> if David knew Him as his Shepherd, <br> if Elijah knew Him as the Almighty, <br> if Daniel knew Him as the Lion Tamer, <br> if Mary Magdalene knew Him as the Bondage Breaker, <br> if Martha knew Him as the Promise Keeper, <br> if Lazarus knew Him as the Resurrection and the Life, <br> if Bartimaeus knew Him as the Light of the World, <br> if John knew Him as the glorious King upon the throne, <br> <i>Surely you and I can know Him too!</i> The living Person Whom John heard and saw and touched was the same in ages past as He will be in years to come. There is not one God for the Old Testament, another God for the New Testament, another God for today, and still another God for the future. He is the <i>same</i> yesterday, today, and forever.<b> </b>He is enduringly the same! Praise God! You and I <i>can</i> know Him! </p><p>About twenty-five years ago, without a crisis experience but with an unexplainable, intense yearning, I made the decision to seek to know God. Personally. Intimately. Accurately. Experientially. I decided that if each of these Bible characters could know Him then I could too. </p><p>If God hasn&#x2019;t changed, if He is enduringly the same, then if they knew Him and I didn&#x2019;t, the fault must lie with me. So I began a pilgrimage to know God, and that pilgrimage continues to this day. I don&#x2019;t know Him today as well as I want or should, but I know Him better today than I did twenty-five years ago. I know Him better today than I did one year ago. I am growing in my knowledge of God, and I say without hesitation or qualification that knowing God is my joy and reason for living. He is... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Wind beneath my wings, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Treasure that I seek, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Foundation on which I build, &nbsp; &nbsp; the Song in my heart, &nbsp; the Object of my desire, the Breath of my life&#x2014; <i>He is my All in all!</i> Please join with me in this life-changing <br> discovery as, through the Gospel of John, <br> God just gives us Jesus. Although we may <br> have many preconceived ideas of Who Jesus is, John will show us He is actually bigger than we think and greater than we think.&nbsp; <br> Jesus Is Greater Than I Think The One Who was with God and was God and is the same today as He was in the beginning is the Creator: "Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made" (John 1:3).

Reissue.</p><p>Patricia Wentworth was born in India and after writing several romances turned her hand to crime. She wrote dozens of bestselling mysteries before her death in the late Sixties, and was recognised as one of the mistresses of classic crime.Written in 1929, a year before the publication of Agatha Christie&#39;s first Miss Marple, Wentworth&#39;s mystery features Miss Silver, an elderly private investigator who puts aside her voracious knitting to help Charles Moray untangle a vicious conspiracy. Moray has returned from four years abroad after being jilted a week before his wedding. Now he finds that his former fiance is involved in sinister activities. Rather than going to the police, he turns to Miss Silver for assistance. Diana Bishop delivers an old-fashioned performance that works well with the vintage story.

Ranging freely and with great authority through realms of history, folklore, and myth, it combines two seemingly disparate genres &#x2013; the World War II action thriller and the paranormal romance &#x2013; into a seamless, irresistible whole.McCammon's hero is Michael Gallatin, embattled inhabitant of two different worlds. Born into the Russian aristocracy, but &#x201c;changed&#x201d; and raised by a pack of werewolves, Michael's journey takes him from the wild regions of his native Russia to the battle-scarred landscapes of a world at war. Offering his unique talents to the Allied cause, Michael becomes a sort of secret weapon aimed at the destruction of Hitler and his &#x201c;Thousand Year Reich.&#x201d; His adventures take him from the deserts of North Africa to the German-occupied countries of Western Europe. There, with the aid of a vivid assortment of friends, comrades, and lovers, he uncovers a horrific conspiracy known as &#x201c;Iron Fist,&#x201d; which threatens to disrupt the Allies' long-planned invasion of Europe and to alter the very outcome of the war.Both a scrupulously researched historical thriller and a brilliant re-imagining of the traditional werewolf tale, The Wolf's Hour offers pleasure, excitement, and illumination on virtually every page. Exotic, enthralling, and endlessly inventive, it is the work of a master storyteller in full command of his matchless narrative gifts.The Subterranean Press edition of The Wolf's Hour will feature an original introduction by Robert McCammon, as well as a full-color dust jacket and a number of color plates by Vincent Chong, including a gatefold illustration depicting the novel's famous &#x201c;death train&#x201d; scene.Robert McCammon is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Boy's Life</i> and <i>Gone South</i>, among many critically acclaimed works of fiction, with millions of copies of his novels in print.

When all sword manufacture was prohibited in Japan for seven years after World War II, the age-old techniques were in danger of being lost forever. Today, in the hands of a new generation of practitioners, the craft is making a startling comeback. Connoisseurs say that the swords being produced now are the equal of anything made in Japan in the past few hundred years. <br><br>This book takes the reader into the workshops of four of Japan's leading sword craftsmen. Each craftsman has a different role in the manufacture of a blade. Yoshindo Yoshihara, the swordsmith, begins with raw steel made in a traditional charcoal-fueled smelter and refines it by folding and forging, gradually shaping it into a sword with a hardened edge. Okisato Fujishiro then sharpens and polishes the sword with fine stones to reveal the color and texture of the steel. Metalworker Hiroshi Miyajima makes the small copper-and-gold habaki collar that fits between the blade and the scabbard. Finally, Kazuyuki Takayama carves the hilt and the scabbard out of a single piece of wood. Black-and-white photographs show every stage of the manufacture, while important information on history, metallurgy, and modern-day appraisal is presented in an extensive introduction. <br><br>The swords made in Japan today are not, of course, intended for actual use. But their design, the quality of their steel, and the techniques used to create them still derive from the sword's historical function as a lethal hand-held weapon. A sword must be razor sharp, light, well balanced, and strong, but not so brittle it will break. In the perfect resolution of these qualities lie the beauty of the blade and the challenge of the craft. <br><br>This book demonstrates how brilliantly Japan's sword craftsmen today have met this technological challenge. The impulse of the craft now is to preserve the utilitarian object and yet create an enduring art for the modern age. While many fine books on sword appreciation exist, these deal primarily with older blades or problems of appraisal. <em>The Craft of the Japanese Sword</em> is the first book in English devoted entirely to contemporary sword manufacture, and will thus be of enormous value to metal artists everywhere, as well as to collectors and students of weaponry.</p><p><br>LEON KAPP is a molecular biologist at the University of California in San Francisco. He has studied swordmaking in Japan at the forge of the swordsmith Yoshindo Yoshihara. <br><br>HIROKO KAPP was active as a graphic artist in Tokyo for ten years and is now a correspondent for the Tokyo-based <em>Senken</em> news organization. The Kapps live in San Rafael, California. <br><br>YOSHINDO YOSHIHARA is a tenth-generation swordsmith who is ranked among the top sword craftsmen in Japan today. He began forging blades at the age of twelve and has exhibited several times in the United States. His son is currently working with him and will become the eleventh generation of the family to carry on the tradition.<br></p><h2>The Dobsonian Telescope: A Practical Manual for Building Large Aperture Telescopes</h2><p>This book tells how you can build a state-of-the-art Dobsonian telescope using readily available materials and supplies. Every step of construction is detailedin photographs and diagrams, and the underlying ideas are carefully explained. As a result of this three-year collaboration between authors David Kriege and Richard Berry, experienced and well-known telescope makers, you now have the opportunity to build a high-performance telescope from 14 inches to 40 inches aperture based on the thoroughly tested designs described in this book. The Dobsonian telescope takes its name from the astronomer/philosopher John Dobson, who introduced the concept of inexpensive, large-aperture telescopes to astronomy. Amateur astronomers at the time were so amazed that a telescope builtfrom simple, inexpensive materials performed so well that they could hardly believe their eyes. As home-built Dobsonians started showing up at star parties across the nation and people saw what Dobsonians could do, the word spread. In just a few years, the Dobsonian revolution swept the world. Since those early telescopes, Dobsonians have improved dramatically. An entire generation of amateur telescope makers contributed their best insights and refinements to Dobson&#39;s original design. Today&#39;s Dobsonians are larger, lighter,and more precise than ever before. For example, it is possible to build a telescope of 20 inches aperture that is compact enough to transp</p><p></p><h2>Inside the Bungalow: America&#39;s Arts and Crafts Interior</h2><p>Shows interior architectural details, furnishings, and built-in features of a variety of Craftsman style houses</p><p></p><h2>The Nature of Animal Healing: The Path to Your Pet&#39;s Health, Happiness, and Longevity</h2><p><b>The Nature of Animal Healing</b> is a groundbreaking, inspirational contribution to animal care. Dr. Martin Goldstein, one of the most successful and best-known holistic veterinarians in the country, offers here, for the first time, invaluable insights into how to give our pets a healthy, happy, and long life.<br><br>Dr. Goldstein--a graduate of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine who runs a renowned clinic in South Salem, New York--begins by explaining his approach to alternative treatment: what it is, how it works, and why it's especially important that animals be treated holistically. Holistic pet care essentially revolves around the notion that the best way to cure an animal who is ill is to help the animal cure itself. We are not the true healers of our pets--they are. By treating the root of the problem instead of its symptoms, holistic medicine enables our pets to regain and maintain their own health.<br><br>In this comprehensive and accessible book, Dr. Goldstein not only shares his philosophy of how animals should--must--be treated, but also shows us exactly what to do. With moving and often entertaining examples from his years of practice, he offers prescriptive advice for the pet lover of every stripe: why we shouldn't feed our animals commercial pet food; why vaccines can actually do more harm than good; how acupuncture and homeopathic medicine can be used to help our pets; why pets need to experience a "healing crisis" in order to get well; and much, much more.<br><br>In his practice, Dr. Goldstein has had extraordinary success treating cancer and leukemia. Here, he begins to decipher the riddle of those killer diseases and shows us how best to treat them, as well as how to prevent them from occurring. Included is the exhaustive "Alphabet of Ailments," a list that tackles common afflictions one by one--the most useful guide ever published in a book on animal care.<br><br>Dr. Goldstein also turns to the spiritual realm, addressing how the emotional bonds we form with our animals have the power to provoke and cure disease. In his smart, helpful, and comforting style, he tells us how to deal with the inevitable death of a pet--both physically and psychologically.<br><br>Finally, there is an indispensable source guide: a complete listing of pet health-care centers, doctors, and products. So wherever you live, you will be able to act on the advice and recommendations you are sure to take to heart.<br><br><b>The Nature of Animal Healing</b> is a revolutionary guide that no pet owner should be without.</p><p>As an accomplished doctor of veterinary medicine, Martin Goldstein is well respected for his 25 years worth of experience in the field--experience he effectively utilizes in conjunction with his expertise in holistic medicine in his new book, <i>The Nature of Animal Healing: The Path to Your Pet's Health, Happiness, and Longevity</i>. Goldstein begins with a broad explanation of the origins of diseases in pets, then moves on to taking action against those diseases, not only offering thorough discussions of specific ailments--including cancer, allergies, and arthritis--and the holistic medicines available to help in the healing process, but also speaking to the "dubious legacy of vaccines" as well as the questionable quality of pet food. Finally, Goldstein turns his attention to the spiritual realm, addressing both the bonds that we have with our pets--and how those bonds aid in preventing and fighting our pets' health problems--as well as dealing with the death of a beloved pet. Goldstein's expert advice, inclusion of inspiring real-life cases, and thorough resource "compendium of holistic books, newsletters, Web sites, veterinarians, and associations" make this book a valuable addition to any pet owner's library. <i>--Julia King</i>"<i>The Nature of Animal Healing</i> gives you chapter and verse on how to help your pet live a long, happy and healthy life.

When you read it, you recognize truth, and rejoice that a caring human being and veterinarian finally addresses what we all instinctively know."<br>--Anne Archer</p><p>--"Martin Goldstein explores on a deep level the relationship between animals, humans and healing. He courageously steps out on the thin ice of controversy and says 'no disease is incurable.' This book is about his love and commitment to pets, their owners, and health."<br>--Martin DeAngelis, D.V.M.; Village Animal Clinic; Ardsley, NY</p><p>" . . . a vivid and engrossing account of how toxic environment and poor diet are proving as deadly to our animals as they are to us . . . the case [Goldstein] builds is exuberantly persuasive . . . .

The story is pretty grim: Teenaged Wolff moves with his divorced mother from Florida to Utah to Washington State to escape her violent boyfriend. When she remarries, Wolff finds himself in a bitter battle of wills with his abusive stepfather, a contest in which the two prove to be more evenly matched than might have been supposed. Deception, disguise, and illusion are the weapons the young man learns to employ as he grows up--not bad training for a writer-to-be. Somber though this tale of family strife is, it is also darkly funny and so artistically satisfying that most readers come away exhilarated rather than depressed.The author of three collections of stories, Tobias Wolff lives with his family near Stanford University, where he is the director of the creative writing program.</p><h2>The Rise of Evangelicalism: The Age of Edwards, Whitefield and the Wesleys</h2><p><ul><li>Winner of a <em>Christianity Today</em> 2005 Book Award</li></ul> The word <em>evangelical</em> is widely used and widely misunderstood. <ul><li>Where did evangelicals come from?</li><li>What motivated them?</li><li>How did their influence become so widespread throughout the world during the eighteenth century?</li></ul> This inaugural book, in a series that charts the course of English-speaking evangelicalism over the last 300 years, offers a multinational narrative of the origin, development and rapid diffusion of evangelical movements in their first two generations. Theology, hymnody, gender, warfare, politics and science are all taken into consideration. But the focus is on the landmark individuals, events and organizations that shaped the story of the beginnings of this vibrant Christian movement. The revivals in Britain and North America in the mid-eighteenth century proved to be foundational in the development of the movement, its ethos, beliefs and subsequent direction. In these revivals, the core commitments of evangelicals were formed that continue to this day.

His reporting skills landed him a post in Berlin in the mid-1930s, where he was able to see firsthand Adolf Hitler's ascent to power, an experience that illuminated the pages of Shirer's classic, <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</i>.<p> <i>"This Is Berlin"</i>, a collection of Shirer's radio scripts, crackles with even greater immediacy. It describes, as they were occurring, the great events on which Shirer would reflect in his later book, among them the Nazi annexation of Austria and northwestern Czechoslovakia, the Munich Pact, the German invasion of Poland, and subsequent conquest of much of the rest of Europe. Acting as eyes and ears for his American audience, Shirer provides details that are often absent from standard histories of World War II, among them the viewpoints of the German media and ordinary citizens in the face of crisis. He also delivers revealing tidbits of information in passing, such as his list of the bestselling books in Germany at the start of World War II--at the top of which is Margaret Mitchell's <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, followed by the expected anti-British and anti-Soviet screeds. Shirer's reportage makes for fascinating reading, and it provides an important new primary source for historians, as well. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>William L. Shirer (1904-94) was a newspaper correspondent and radio journalist in the years before and during World War II. He is the author of the critically acclaimed bestseller <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</i> (1960) as well as <i>Berlin Diary</i> (1941), <i>The Nightmare Years</i> (1984), and many other works.</p><h2>The Only Child: Being One, Loving One, Understanding One, Raising One</h2><p><p>Darrell Sifford, an only child himself, has drawn from countless case studies and interviewed a wide range of psychologists to come up with a unique picture of the only child.

His brother, Christian, joined him a decade later. By 1875 their firm, renamed Herter Brothers, was supplying the White House with furnishings, as it had been doing for some of America's wealthiest families since 1858. During this opulent period, Herter Brothers could claim to be the leading cabinetmaking and decorating firm in the country.<br>The Herter brothers' extraordinary accomplishment has never before been the subject of a book. Here, at last, is an in-depth study of these talented men, their company, and its work, prized then as now for its design, richness of materials and detail, superb craftsmanship, and splendid diversity. The best of the Herter Brothers' furniture and interiors are displayed in 133 color and 167 black-and-white illustrations, including many close-up details as well as comparative work by rival fine cabinetmakers of the time in New York and Europe.<br>Herter Brothers tells the story of the company from its earliest manifestations, when Gustave worked with other partners and alone, through his partnership with his brother, to Christian's years as head of the firm and the end of his tenure. The book places the company firmly in its context, international as well as domestic, with an extensive discussion of the brothers' background and influences and an absorbing narrative of the furniture and decoration trade in New York City in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Also described is the superb work done by the firm for their fabulously wealthy patrons - a who's who of the Gilded Age, including J. Pierpont Morgan, William H. Vanderbilt, and Jay Gould - for whom the Herters created some of their most lavish furniture and complete interiors. These commissions, many illustrated here, included woodwork, plasterwork, lighting fixtures, window treatments, wall and ceiling paintings, carpets, textiles, mosaics, stained glass, and decorative objects in addition to furniture.</p><p>Gustave Herter fled to America in 1848, followed by his brother, Christian, in 1859. By 1875 the furniture from the "Herter Brothers" shop was in great demand by America's wealthiest families, who were decorating in the opulent style that would give the era the name "Gilded Age." This first in-depth study of the unique style and creations of the Herters, who worked with exotic woods and ornate inlay combined with ebonizing and gilding, is published in conjunction with an exhibit that will tour Houston, Atlanta, and New York. Lavishly illustrated with 167 black-and-white photos of historic interiors and 133 color plates, including many close-ups of their detailed work, this volume clearly shows why the Herters were wooed for their furnishings by J.P. Morgan, Jay Gould, Theodore Roosevelt, and all the Vanderbilts. Fine supplementary reading for those who enjoyed the Wharton novel and Scorsese film The Age of Innocence; highly recommended.<br><i>Joseph Hewgley, Nash-ville P.L.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Experts in the field of decorative arts contribute historically detailed essays to this fine book, serving as a catalogue for a recent exhibition that pays a long overdue tribute to the lavishly crafted furniture and art objects of Christian and Gustave Herter. If the Herter brothers' name is not as well known as such contemporary designers as William Morris, this book will be a fitting introduction to the exquisite work they produced. Many of the gilded, ornately carved, and marquetry-embellished cabinets, chairs, and tables pictured here adorned residences of prosperous patrons--J. P. Morgan, William Vanderbilt, and the White House, among others. In numerous color photographs and vintage images depicting entire interiors designed by their firm, this beautiful study gives duly merited attention to the Herter brothers' legacy. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>Essential Pleasures: A New Anthology of Poems to Read Aloud</h2><p><p><strong>A vibrant anthology and accompanying CD that revive a great American tradition: the joy of reciting poetry aloud.</strong></p> This lively, abundant book is distinguished by its focus on hearing poetry read aloud. Robert Pinsky, beloved for his ability to bring poetry to life as spoken language, has collected poems that sound marvelous in a reader&#x2019;s actual or imagined voice. Pinsky has organized the book into sections with brief introductions that emphasize the attentive, intuitive, and reflective process of listening to poetry. This structure provides an implicit, generous definition-by-example of poetry itself: beginning with &#x201c;Short Lines, Frequent Rhymes&#x201d; and &#x201c;Long Lines&#x201d; and proceeding through fundamental themes such as &#x201c;Love Poems,&#x201d; &#x201c;Odes, Complaints, and Celebrations,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Jokes, Ripostes, Parodies, and Insults.&#x201d;<em>Essential Pleasures</em> gives a fresh setting to traditional favorites, including poems by William Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, and Robert Frost, placed among contemporary poems by John Ashbery, Louise Glu�ck, Yusef Komunyakaa, and many others. This is an inviting and distinguished collection and an essential book for every home.</p><p>Robert Pinsky is the author of ten collections of poetry including, most recently, At the Foundling Hospital. His translation The Inferno of Dante won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in Poetry. His brief guide The Sounds of Poetry is used in acting classes. As a three-term United States Poet Laureate, Pinsky founded the Favorite Poem Project, in which thousands of Americans shared their favorite poems. That project gave rise to three previous anthologies, Americans&#x2019; Favorite Poems, An Invitation to Poetry, and Singing School. Pinsky lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and teaches at Boston University.Pinsky, poet, scholar,&nbsp;and poetry advocate, has been a motivating and innovative force in the great popularization of poetry. His Favorite Poem Project brought poetry lovers of all ages and tastes together in a stream of excellent anthologies, including Poems to Read (2002), and he continues to match erudition with unabashed fun in his latest dynamic endeavor. Pinsky&#x2019;s mission is to share both the &#x201c;intellectual and bodily&#x201d; pleasures of poetry, the latter best appreciated when poetry is read out loud&#x2014;hence this ebullient read-aloud anthology. With an oceanic knowledge of poetry and a musical ear, Pinksy has assembled an astonishingly vital, enjoyable, centuries-spanning array cleverly organized by form. Here are beautiful, mournful, and funny love poems; narrative poems; odes; complaints; celebrations; parodies; and insults by&nbsp;both celebrated and obscure poets. A CD of Pinsky&#x2019;s expert readings accompanies the book, but the point is to do it yourself. Readers who read these&nbsp;wisely selected poems out loud, whether to themselves, a sweetheart, friend, cat, or plant, will be amazed at what they discover. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Mat, Mount and Frame It Yourself</h2><p>Now it&#x2019;s easier than ever to save time and money doing your own framing at home.<br><br>This one-stop source demonstrates how easy it is to mat, mount, and frame art on paper and cloth, as well as three-dimensional objects.

Her first crime fiction novel, A Cold Day for Murder, won an Edgar award. Her first thriller, Blindfold Game, hit the New York Times bestseller list.Stabenow's hardcover debut marks the fourth outing for Kate Shugak (last seen in Dead in the Water ), a native Aleut who is building a solid reputation as a tough freelance investigator. Although Kate has no love for the oil companies drilling in Alaska, she accepts a commission from Royal Petroleum Co. to find out who is bringing drugs into the Prudhoe Bay work site where there have been several overdoses and one death. Over the objections of RPetCo's security chief, Lou Childress, Kate goes in as an employee, getting a good look at her surroundings as a driver for Toni Hartzler, who gives PR tours to visiting dignitaries. She gains an instant "in" with the locals when she encounters Jerry McIsaac, an old acquaintance who works there as a medic. Kate spots plenty of drugs at her first party but doesn't observe anyone dealing. Of equal interest to her are the Native American artifacts being unearthed by archeologists at a local dig. While Kate is getting caught up in artifacts, she fails to notice that the dealers themselves are playing sleuth, putting her in danger. Throughout, Stabenow makes effective use of the regional setting, culture and Kate's personal heritage to add depth and color to this brisk and thoughtful tale.

In another context, it would have risked annoying the messenger, but this time the servant of the Dai-kvo seemed to be expecting a certain level of disbelief. Without hesitation, he repeated his words.&nbsp;&#x201c;The Dai-kvo requests Maati Vaupathai come immediately to his private chambers.&#x201d;&nbsp;It was widely understood in the shining village of the Dai-kvo that Maati Vaupathai was, if not a failure, certainly an embarrassment. Over the years he had spent in the writing rooms and lecture halls, walking the broad, clean streets, and huddled with others around the kilns of the firekeepers, Maati had grown used to the fact that he would never be entirely accepted by those who surrounded him; it had been eight years since the Dai-kvo had deigned to speak to him directly. Maati closed the brown leather book he had been studying and slipped it into his sleeve. He took a pose that accepted the message and announced his readiness. The white-robed messenger turned smartly and led the way.&nbsp;The village that was home to the Dai-kvo and the poets was always beautiful. Now in the middle spring, flowers and ivies scented the air and threatened to overflow the well-tended gardens and planters, but no stray grass rose between the paving stones. The gentle choir of wind chimes filled the air. The high, thin waterfall that fell beside the palaces shone silver, and the towers and garrets&#x2014;carved from the mountain face itself&#x2014;were unstained even by the birds that roosted in the eaves. Men spent lifetimes, Maati knew, keeping the village immaculate and as impressive as a Khai on his seat. The village and palaces seemed as grand as the great bowl of sky above them. His years living among the men of the village&#x2014;only men, no women were permitted&#x2014;had never entirely robbed Maati of his awe at the place. He struggled now to hold himself tall, to appear as calm and self-possessed as a man summoned to the Dai-kvo regularly. As he passed through the archways that led to the palace, he saw several messengers and more than a few of the brown-robed poets pause to look at him.&nbsp;He was not the only one who found his presence there strange.&nbsp;The servant led him through the private gardens to the modest apartments of the most powerful man in the world. Maati recalled the last time he had been there&#x2014;the insults and recriminations, the Dai-kvo&#x2019;s scorching sarcasm, and his own certainty and pride crumbling around him like sugar castles left out in the rain. Maati shook himself. There was no reason for the Dai-kvo to have called him back to repeat the indignities of the past.&nbsp;There are always the indignities of the future, the soft voice that had become Maati&#x2019;s muse said from a corner of his mind. Never assume you can survive the future because you&#x2019;ve survived the past. Everyone thinks that, and they&#x2019;ve all been wrong eventually.&nbsp;The servant stopped before the elm-and-oak-inlaid door that led, Maati remembered, to a meeting chamber. He scratched it twice to announce them, then opened the door and motioned Maati in. Maati breathed deeply as a man preparing to dive from a cliff into shallow water and entered.&nbsp;The Dai-kvo was sitting at his table. He had not had hair since Maati had met him twenty-three summers before when the Dai-kvo had only been Tahi-kvo, the crueler of the two teachers set to sift through the discarded sons of the Khaiem and utkhaiem for likely candidates to send on to the village. His brows had gone pure white since he&#x2019;d become the Dai-kvo, and the lines around his mouth had deepened. His black eyes were just as alive.&nbsp;The other two men in the room were strangers to Maati. The thinner one sat at the table across from the Dai-kvo, his robes deep blue and gold, his hair pulled back to show graying temples and a thin white-flecked beard. The thicker&#x2014;with both fat and muscle, Maati thought&#x2014;stood at window, one foot up on the thick ledge, looking into the gardens, and Maati could see where his clean-shaven jaw sagged at the jowl. His robes were the light brown color of sand, his boots hard leather and travel worn. He turned to look at Maati as the door closed, and there was something familiar about him&#x2014;about both these new men&#x2014;that he could not describe. He fell into the old pose, the first one he had learned at the school.&nbsp;&#x201c;I am honored by your presence, most high Dai-kvo.&#x201d;&nbsp;The Dai-kvo grunted and gestured to him for the benefit of the two strangers.&nbsp;&#x201c;This is the one,&#x201d; the Dai-kvo said. The men shifted to look at him, graceful and sure of themselves as merchants considering a pig. Maati imagined what they saw him for&#x2014;a man of thirty summers, his forehead already pushing back his hairline, the smallest of pot bellies. A soft man in a poet&#x2019;s robes, ill-considered and little spoken of. He felt himself start to blush, clenched his teeth, and forced himself to show neither his anger nor his shame as he took a pose of greeting to the two men.&nbsp;&#x201c;Forgive me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe we have met before, or if we have, I apologize that I don&#x2019;t recall it.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t met,&#x201d; the thicker one said.&nbsp;&#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t much to look at,&#x201d; the thin one said, pointedly speaking to the Dai-kvo. The thicker scowled and sketched the briefest of apologetic poses. It was a thread thrown to a drowning man, but Maati found himself appreciating even the empty form of courtesy.&nbsp;&#x201c;Sit down, Maati-cha,&#x201d; the Dai-kvo said, gesturing to a chair. &#x201c;Have a bowl of tea. There&#x2019;s something we have to discuss. Tell me what you&#x2019;ve heard of events in the winter cities.&#x201d;&nbsp;Maati sat and spoke while the Dai-kvo poured the tea.&nbsp;&#x201c;I only know what I hear at the teahouses and around the kilns, most high. There&#x2019;s trouble with the glassblowers in Cetani; something about the Khai Cetani raising taxes on exporting fishing bulbs. But I haven&#x2019;t heard anyone taking it very seriously. Amnat-Tan is holding a summer fair, hoping, they say, to take trade from Yalakeht. And the Khai Machi . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;Maati stopped. He realized now why the two strangers seemed familiar; who they reminded him of. The Dai-kvo pushed a fine ceramic bowl across the smooth-sanded grain of the table. Maati fell into a pose of thanks without being aware of it, but did not take the bowl.&nbsp;&#x201c;The Khai Machi is dying,&#x201d; the Dai-kvo said. &#x201c;His belly&#x2019;s gone rotten. It&#x2019;s a sad thing. Not a good end. And his eldest son is murdered. Poisoned. What do the teahouses and kilns say of that?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;That it was poor form,&#x201d; Maati said. &#x201c;That no one has seen the Khaiem resort to poison since Udun, thirteen summers ago. But neither of the brothers has appeared to accuse the other, so no one . . . Gods! You two are . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;You see?&#x201d; the Dai-kvo said to the thin man, smiling as he spoke. &#x201c;No, not much to look at, but a decent stew between his ears. Yes, Maati-cha. The man scraping my windowsill with his boots there is Danat Machi. This is his eldest surviving brother, Kaiin. And they have come here to speak with me instead of waging war against each other because neither of them killed their elder brother Biitrah.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;So they . . . you think it was Otah-kvo?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;The Dai-kvo says you know my younger brother,&#x201d; the thickset man&#x2014;Danat&#x2014;said, taking his own seat at the only unoccupied side of the table. &#x201c;Tell me what you know of Otah.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen him in years, Danat-cha,&#x201d; Maati said. &#x201c;He was in Saraykeht when . . . when the old poet there died. He was working as a laborer. But I haven&#x2019;t seen him since.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Do you think he was satisfied by that life?&#x201d; the thin one&#x2014;Kaiin&#x2014;asked. &#x201c;A laborer at the docks of Saraykeht hardly seems like the fate a son of the Khaiem would embrace. Especially one who refused the brand.&#x201d;&nbsp;Maati picked up the bowl of tea, sipping it too quickly as he tried to gain himself a moment to think. The tea scalded his tongue.&nbsp;&#x201c;I never heard Otah speak of any ambitions for his father&#x2019;s chair,&#x201d; Maati said.&nbsp;&#x201c;And is there any reason to think he would have spoken of it to you?&#x201d; Kaiin said, the faintest sneer in his voice. Maati felt the blush creeping into his cheeks again, but it was the Dai-kvo who answered.&nbsp;&#x201c;There is. Otah Machi and Maati here were close for a time. They fell out eventually over a woman, I believe. Still, I hold that if Otah had been bent on taking part in the struggle for Machi at that time, he would have taken Maati into his confidence. But that is hardly our concern. As Maati here points out, it was years ago. Otah may have become ambitious. Or resentful. There&#x2019;s no way for us to know that&#x2014;&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;But he refused the brand&#x2014;&#x201d; Danat began, and the Dai-kvo cut him off with a gesture.&nbsp;&#x201c;There were other reasons for that,&#x201d; the Dai-kvo said sharply. &#x201c;They aren&#x2019;t your concern.&#x201d;&nbsp;Danat Machi took a pose of apology and the Dai-kvo waved it away. Maati sipped his tea again. This time it didn&#x2019;t burn. To his right, Kaiin Machi took a pose of query, looking directly at Maati for what seemed the first time.&nbsp;&#x201c;Would you know him again if you saw him?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Maati said. &#x201c;I would.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;You sound certain of it.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;I am, Kaiin-cha.&#x201d;&nbsp;The thin man smiled. All around the table a sense of satisfaction seemed to come from his answer. Maati found it unnerving. The Dai-kvo poured himself more tea, the liquid clicking into his bowl like a stream over stones.&nbsp;&#x201c;There is a very good library in Machi,&#x201d; the Dai-kvo said. &#x201c;One of the finest in the fourteen cities. I understand there are records there from the time of the Empire. One of the high lords was thinking to go there, perhaps, to ride out the war, and sent his books ahead. I&#x2019;m sure there are treasures hidden among those shelves that would be of use in binding the andat.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Maati asked.&nbsp;&#x201c;No, not really,&#x201d; the Dai-kvo said. &#x201c;I expect it&#x2019;s a mess of poorly documented scraps overseen by a librarian who spends his copper on wine and whores, but I don&#x2019;t care. For our purposes, there are secrets hidden in those records important enough to send a low-ranking poet like yourself to sift though. I have a letter to the Khai Machi that will explain why you are truly there. He will explain your presence to the utkhaiem and Cehmai Tyan, the poet who holds Stone-Made-Soft. Let them think you&#x2019;ve come on my errand. What you will be doing instead is discovering whether Otah killed Biitrah Machi. If so, who is backing him. If not, who did, and why.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Most high&#x2014;&#x201d; Maati began.&nbsp;&#x201c;Wait for me in the gardens,&#x201d; the Dai-kvo said. &#x201c;I have a few more things to discuss with the sons of Machi.&#x201d;&nbsp;The gardens, like the apartments, were small, well kept, beautiful, and simple. A fountain murmured among carefully shaped, deeply fragrant pine trees. Maati sat, looking out. From the side of mountain, the world spread out before him like a map. He waited, his head buzzing, his heart in turmoil. Before long he heard the steady grinding sound of footsteps on gravel, and he turned to see the Dai-kvo making his way down the path toward him. Maati stood. He had not known the Dai-kvo had started walking with a cane. A servant followed at a distance, carrying a chair, and did not approach until the Dai-kvo signaled. Once the chair was in place, looking out over the same span that Maati had been considering, the servant retreated.&nbsp;&#x201c;Interesting, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; the Dai-kvo said.&nbsp;Maati, unsure whether he meant the view or the business with the sons of Machi, didn&#x2019;t reply. The Dai-kvo looked at him, something part smile, part something less congenial on his lips. He drew forth two packets&#x2014;letters sealed in wax and sewn shut. Maati took them and tucked them in his sleeve.&nbsp;&#x201c;Gods. I&#x2019;m getting old. You see that tree?&#x201d; the Dai-kvo asked, pointing at one of the shaped pines with his cane.&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, most high.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a family of robins that lives in it. They wake me up every morning. I always mean to have someone break the nest, but I&#x2019;ve never quite given the order.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;You are merciful, most high.&#x201d;&nbsp;The old man looked up at him, squinting. His lips were pressed thin, and the lines in his face were black as charcoal. Maati stood waiting. At length, the Dai-kvo turned away again with a sigh.&nbsp;&#x201c;Will you be able to do it?&#x201d; he asked.&nbsp;&#x201c;I will do as the Dai-kvo commands,&#x201d; Maati said.&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, I know you&#x2019;ll go there. But will you be able to tell me that he&#x2019;s there? You know if he is behind this, they&#x2019;ll kill him before they go on to each other. Are you able to bear that responsibility? Tell me now if you aren&#x2019;t, and I&#x2019;ll find some other way. You don&#x2019;t have to fail again.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t fail again, most high.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Good. That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; the Dai-kvo said and went silent. Maati waited so long for the pose that would dismiss him that he wondered whether the Dai-kvo had forgotten he was there, or had chosen to ignore him as an insult. But the old man spoke, his voice low.&nbsp;&#x201c;How old is your son, Maati-cha?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Twelve, most high. But I haven&#x2019;t seen him in some years.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re angry with me for that.&#x201d; Maati began to take a pose of denial, but checked himself and lowered his arms. This wasn&#x2019;t the time for court politics. The Dai-kvo saw this and smiled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting wiser, my boy. You were a fool when you were young. In itself, that&#x2019;s not such a bad thing. Many men are. But you embraced your mistakes. You defended them against all correction. That was the wrong path, and don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m unaware of how you&#x2019;ve paid for it.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;As you say, most high.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;I told you there was no place in a poet&#x2019;s life for a family. A lover here or there, certainly. Most men are too weak to deny themselves that much. But a wife? A child? No. There isn&#x2019;t room for both what they require and what we do. And I told you that. You remember? I told you that, and you . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;The Dai-kvo shook his head, frowning in remembered frustration. It was a moment, Maati knew, when he could apologize. He could repent his pride and say that the Dai-kvo had indeed known better all along. He remained silent.&nbsp;&#x201c;I was right,&#x201d; the Dai-kvo said for him. &#x201c;And now you&#x2019;ve done half a job as a poet and half a job as a man. Your studies are weak, and the woman took your whelp and left. You&#x2019;ve failed both, just as I knew you would. I&#x2019;m not condemning you for that, Maati. No man could have taken on what you did and succeeded. But this opportunity in Machi is what will wipe clean the slate. Do this well and it will be what you&#x2019;re remembered for.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Certainly I will do my best.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Fail at it, and there won&#x2019;t be a third chance. Few enough men have two.&#x201d;&nbsp;Maati took a pose appropriate to a student receiving a lecture. Considering him, the Dai-kvo responded with one that closed the lesson, then raised his hand.&nbsp;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t destroy this chance in o...</p><h2>Letters from Father Christmas, Revised Edition</h2><p>The fanciful letters from &#34;Santa&#34; that J. R. R. Tolkien wrote his children at Christmas time celebrate the wild imagination and creative vigor of the fantasy writer as he used his talents to entertain the young.</p><p>J.R.R. Tolkien (1892&#x2013;1973), beloved throughout the world as the creator of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. His chief interest was the linguistic aspects of the early English written tradition, but even as he studied these classics he was creating a set of his own.Don't miss this little gem amidst all the fanfare of Tolkien's novels and Hollywood film. Each year, starting in the early 1920s Tolkien responded to his children's letters to Father Christmas with notes and drawings. He introduces the chores of packing the many packages, the mishaps of weather and the mischief of his faithful helper, North Polar Bear, to his sons and daughter--whose names are added or omitted from the letters as the family grows. Derek Jacobi is fully in the spirit of these epistles, and listeners hear how Tolkien, also, elaborates with one year's letters, and can only send a few lines and a drawing the next. The one missed step is the annoying choice of just one music selection which separates the letters. Nevertheless, make this audio program a holiday tradition.

Being God&#x2019;s Vicar here on earth, surely he would be granted divine sight into the hearts and souls of men as soon as that silly papal hat everyone insisted on calling a tiara was lowered onto his brow. The truth is, most popes don&#x2019;t have divine insight into much of anything. If they did, they&#x2019;d get on with the business of making saints and saving souls rather than pronouncing velvet gowns impious or persecuting the poor Jews. Blasphemy it may be, but most popes have no more insight into the minds of humanity than does any carter or candlestick maker walking the streets of Rome in wooden clogs.</p><p>And my Pope was no exception. He was the cleverest man I knew in some ways&#x2014;those dark eyes of his had only to pass benignly over his bowing cardinals to know exactly which ones were scheming against him, and certainly that despicable French King had learned not to cross wits or swords with Rodrigo Borgia over the past year and a half since I&#x2019;d been ransomed. But when it came to his family, His Holiness Pope Alexander VI was as dense as a plank.</p><p>At least at the moment he was a very happy plank.</p><p>&#x201c;Mi familia,&#x201d; he said thickly, and began to raise his goblet but put it down again to dash a heavy hand at the water standing in his eyes. &#x201c;My children all together again. Cesare, Lucrezia, Joffre&#x2014;Juan&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><br><p>The loathsome young Duke of Gandia preened, sitting at his father&#x2019;s right where Rodrigo could easily reach out to touch his favorite son&#x2019;s shoulder. Juan Borgia, twenty years old now and returned from his lands in Spain. Although he was a duke, a husband, even a father (Holy Virgin, fetch me a basin!)&#x2014;that auburn-haired young lout looked no different to me, lolling in his chair fiddling with his dagger hilt, already halfway through his cup of wine and giving me the occasional leer over the rim. I&#x2019;d heaved a great sigh that afternoon, watching him strike a pose before the cheering crowd as he disembarked from his Spanish ship. My lover&#x2019;s second son had been wearing silly stockings embroidered in rays and crowns, and I&#x2019;d realized just how much I&#x2019;d been hoping never to see Juan or his ridiculous clothes or his leer again. As soon as I heard Rodrigo had summoned Juan from Spain to take command of the papal forces against the French, I prayed so devoutly for a shipwreck. You&#x2019;d think someone nicknamed the Bride of Christ could get the occasional prayer answered, wouldn&#x2019;t you?</p><p>But if I wasn&#x2019;t exactly thrilled to see Juan or his silly stockings again, my Pope was&#x2014;he had rushed from his elaborate sedan chair across the docks to embrace his son in a great sweep of embroidered papal robes, kissing both his cheeks and uttering a great many ecstatic things in Catalan which he saved for moments of high emotion. Nobody else had missed Juan when he departed Rome for Barcelona to take possession of the Spanish duchy and the Spanish bride my Pope had inveigled for his favorite son&#x2014;but my Pope certainly had. And nothing would do but to gather the whole family together for an intimate evening cena in the Holy Father&#x2019;s private apartments at the Vatican.</p><p>And what apartments! Just a modest little nest of rooms in the Vatican where the Holy Father could remove his jeweled cope (along with the weight of all Christendom) and relax at the end of the evening like any ordinary man. But Rodrigo Borgia would have nothing ordinary. He had declared he would have the papal apartments new-made, stamped and decorated with a flair that said nothing but Borgia. It had taken two years, but that little painter Maestro Pinturicchio had finally finished the frescoes that had been designed especially for the Holy Father&#x2019;s personal rooms, and the resulting splendor left all Rome gasping. Our small cena tonight had been set in the Sala dei Santi: the long table draped with sumptuous brocades and set with solid silver dishes and fragile Murano glass; the ceiling arched overhead painted in double crowns and the Borgia bull; the frescoes framed with geometric Moorish patterns in a blaze of colors, imported straight from Spain.</p><p>Pinturicchio had used us all as models for his various scenes&#x2014;Lucrezia dimpled and tossed her blond head under the beseeching figure of herself on the wall as Santa Caterina; inscrutable Cesare lounged under his own image as inscrutable Emperor Maximilian in a massive throne; fourteen-year-old Joffre pranced in the painted crowd as one of the background figures; and Juan cut a ridiculous figure on the wall in a silly Turkish mantle as a turbaned heathen. I was a Madonna in one of the other chambers, with my Laura on my lap for the Christ child. &#x201c;Surely it&#x2019;s blasphemous to have a girl sit as model for our Lord!&#x201d; Maestro Pinturicchio had protested.</p><p>&#x201c;Any more blasphemous than to have a harlot sit for the Madonna?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d countered, the Holy Virgin&#x2019;s blue veil swinging about my face like a joke. I&#x2019;d never asked to be a notorious woman; I&#x2019;d been raised for a husband and children like any other girl of noble birth, but here I was. I&#x2019;d made my own choices, and I made no bones either about what it made me&#x2014;but I&#x2019;d been determined to have my Laura in the frescoes along with all the other Borgia children. Maestro Pinturicchio had taken one look at the set of my chin and begun sketching. A nice little man, ugly as the day was long, but skilled. His wife was the most notorious harpy in Rome, and I gave him a rose-quartz and crystal bracelet to give her in the hopes it would sweeten her temper. It hadn&#x2019;t, but he thanked me anyway, and he made Laura look very pretty indeed in our Madonna-and-Child fresco. Though the halo certainly didn&#x2019;t suit her; she was a full three years old now and a proper little imp!</p><p>Rodrigo was still looking about the table with misty eyes, and I ceased my musing. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just Our own children here tonight,&#x201d; he continued, beaming like any proud father despite the regal papal We. &#x201c;Our new children as well. Sancha&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Young Joffre&#x2019;s Neapolitan wife, Sancha of Aragon, was making doe eyes at Cesare through the candlelight, but she dropped her lashes demurely at her father-in-law.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;and of course Lucrezia&#x2019;s Giovanni Sforza is here in our thoughts, if not the flesh. A pity he could not join Us&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Lucrezia giggled behind her hand, not looking very put out about that. My Pope had called her back from her husband&#x2019;s home in Pesaro last winter for a long visit, declaring he could not do without his dear daughter any longer, and certainly I&#x2019;d been delighted to see Lucrezia again, both of us chattering and gossiping in the Palazzo Santa Maria just like the old days when she&#x2019;d been a little girl dreaming of marriage&#x2014;but she had certainly not seemed inclined to go back to her new home now that she was married. I suppose Pesaro&#x2019;s provincial pleasures had worn rather thin after two years. Lord Sforza had stamped off home this spring, muttering of duties that could not be put off, and he&#x2019;d stamped off alone.</p><p>&#x201c;And a pity your beautiful Maria Enriques could not travel with you from Spain,&#x201d; Rodrigo continued, giving Juan&#x2019;s arm another pat. &#x201c;We would have liked to see Our new daughter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She begged to come, but she&#x2019;s breeding again.&#x201d; Juan shrugged, rotating the silver stem of his wine goblet between restless fingers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy enough to leave her behind. The cow is always weeping and praying.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now, now,&#x201d; Rodrigo chuckled. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be mother to another Borgia prince soon!&#x201d; He gave an indulgent shake of his head and raised his goblet. &#x201c;No matter. All of us are together again. As it should be.&#x201d;</p><p>His children raised their goblets too, but I couldn&#x2019;t help noticing that not everybody looked entirely pleased to see la familia Borgia reunited. Joffre was sulking, squashed in beside Juan and ignored by Sancha, and as for Cesare . . .</p><p>&#x201c;La familia,&#x201d; said the Holy Father.</p><p>&#x201c;La familia,&#x201d; everyone echoed, and the look Cesare sent his brother across the table could have kindled the napkins.</p><p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; I said brightly as a stream of papal servants entered with massive silver dishes, &#x201c;how was the crossing from Spain? Did the waves stay smooth for the Duke of Gandia?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Smooth enough,&#x201d; Juan said, eyes flickering to my breasts.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose your Duchess will be very much distressed to have you gone.&#x201d; Myself, I&#x2019;d have thrown a great party in celebration.</p><p>Juan shrugged again, clearly not interested in his wife. His eyes went to Cesare as the first dishes were laid before us on the cena table. &#x201c;So, brother. Hostage to the French, were you? I hear you ran away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Escaped,&#x201d; said Cesare. He was a dark shadow among the candles&#x2014;in his plain black velvets he seemed to eat the light and refuse to give it back again. &#x201c;The Holy Father and I arranged it all. I escaped as a groom shortly after we set out from Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ran,&#x201d; Juan grinned.</p><p>&#x201c;He was ever so brave,&#x201d; Sancha cooed in her milky-sweet voice. She and Joffre had been recalled from their official seat in Naples to Rome that May, and it hadn&#x2019;t taken me more than a week to start despising that velvety purr of hers. I&#x2019;d met Sancha only once, at her wedding to little Joffre when he was twelve and Sancha four years older, and that occasion had been quite enough to make me think we weren&#x2019;t destined to be the best of friends. And when Sancha took an idle look at Leonello at her welcoming banquet and told me, &#x201c;Your dwarf is a fine specimen; have you ever considered breeding him? I have the most cunning little juggling woman&#x2014;&#x201d; Well, after that I&#x2019;d started calling her the Tart of Aragon, and I knew I&#x2019;d happily watch her choke to death on a fish bone. &#x201c;Try the carp, Sancha,&#x201d; I suggested, but she was talking over me and toying with the pearl pendant about her neck to draw attention to her breasts.</p><p>&#x201c;Cesare left all his baggage behind, you know.&#x201d; She left off the pendant long enough to hold her wine cup to be refilled again&#x2014;she certainly could put it away! &#x201c;And when King Charles went to look, he saw that all those chests that were supposed to be filled with coin and silver plate had nothing but stones under a top layer of ducats! You could hear the scream all the way in Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>Juan gave Sancha&#x2019;s breasts an automatic glance, but his attention was all for his brother. &#x201c;I expect I&#x2019;ll do better than run when I see the French, brother.&#x201d;</p><p>Cesare toyed with his table knife.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll send the French packing, boy!&#x201d; my Pope said warmly. He&#x2019;d left off his ecclesiastical robes, and in his embroidered doublet and linen shirtsleeves he could have been any merchant father or ducal paterfamilias: the proud and swarthy Spaniard surrounded by children who all looked like him. &#x201c;We taught them a lesson at Fornovo; now you&#x2019;ll finish them off.&#x201d;</p><p>Really, after all that fuss the French had made declaring they would annex all of Naples and the papal territories too before they were done, everything had petered out so embarrassingly. Well, embarrassing if you were French. After they got their poxy noses bloodied at Fornovo and had to flee back north, my Pope made me a present straight from the French King&#x2019;s own abandoned baggage: a certain diary in execrable handwriting, detailing the ladies who had shared the royal bed on campaign, with descriptions of their skills. &#x201c;No, thank you,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said, wrinkling my nose.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Rodrigo had turned the pages with great interest. &#x201c;There are a few ideas here. Requiring a bit more flexibility than I&#x2019;m capable of at my age, to be sure . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really, Rodrigo,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d scolded. &#x201c;Dirty stories? Whatever happened to giving a woman flowers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then flowers you shall have.&#x201d; And I&#x2019;d acquired a pretty little set of diamond roses to clip into my braided hair. Every time the Tart of Aragon looked at them I could see her little nose twitch with lust. Her little nose was usually twitching with lust of one kind or another. For the past two months it had been twitching for Cesare, in whose lap she appeared to be dandling her hand under cover of the damask tablecloth. She didn&#x2019;t have a glance for poor little Joffre&#x2014;he&#x2019;d grown to a tall gangly youth, but he still seemed like a child to me, sulking in the shadow of his voluptuous wife and his taller, handsomer brothers. I tried to engage him in the conversation&#x2014;&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be next on the battlefield after your brothers, Joffre!&#x201d;&#x2014;but he pushed his lip out in sullen silence and I finally gave up and stabbed at my roast capon, which had been taken off the spit too soon and was now oozing red juice all over my plate like it had been wounded rather than cooked. You&#x2019;d think the Pope would eat better than anyone else in the Holy City, but you&#x2019;d be wrong. It wasn&#x2019;t fair, this reputation he&#x2019;d acquired for dissipation and luxury&#x2014;my Pope was so indifferent to what he ate, he didn&#x2019;t care if the Vatican cooks fed him or his guests on bread and water. Anyone who wanted a decent meal at the Pope&#x2019;s table had better hope they were eating at the Palazzo Santa Maria, where I presided over the table and my fierce Carmelina Mangano held sway in the kitchens. Carmelina would have taken one look at this half-raw chicken and the burned focaccia and the salad with too many capers and gone down to the Vatican kitchens to whack off a few heads.</p><p>I pushed my plate away. All this la familia tension was giving me a headache, and I always eat when I have a headache, but this food was past enjoying. Besides, I was starting to get just a bit plump again&#x2014;some women might be able to stay wand-slim no matter what they ate, but my dresses got tight if I even looked at a plate of tourtes. So very unfair. At least food like this was easy to push away.</p><p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re to be Gonfalonier?&#x201d; Sancha was bubbling now at Juan. &#x201c;Our bold leader against the French! I see bravery in the Borgias isn&#x2019;t limited to just one brother!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One might doubt that,&#x201d; Cesare murmured.</p><p>&#x201c;My husband wanted to lead the papal forces, you know.&#x201d; Lucrezia laughed. &#x201c;Can you imagine? He has trouble enough with those Pesarese captains of his, and now he wants papal soldiers! He thinks he&#x2019;s Alexander the Great, you know; too ridiculous&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Sancha tittered and Juan guffawed; even Rodrigo had a chuckle at his son-in-law&#x2019;s expense, and I couldn&#x2019;t blame him either because Lord Sforza had gotten very sour this past year and spent most of his last visit pestering my Pope for money. But I couldn&#x2019;t help looking at Lucrezia&#x2014;sixteen years old now but as poised as a woman of twice as many years, wearing a purple-and-crimson gown cut as low as Sancha&#x2019;s, rubies in her ears and rouge patted on her cheeks and a ring on every finger. She looked eager and glittering, greedy for every eye to be on her, and I thought back to the gently glowing girl who had first blushed at her new husband over my cena table.</p><p>Well, such girls grew up. And Lucrezia had acted alongside me as her father&#x2019;s hostess this past winter, finally old enough to take her place as the star of the papal court&#x2014;perhaps it had gone to her head just a little. It certainly would have gone to mine at her age. I had only twenty-two years to my name, but sometimes I felt distinctly world-weary.</p><p>They were talking of that mad priest Fra Savonarola now, the one preaching and frothing at the mouth in Florence and g...</p></p><h2>The Angels of Atlantis: Twelve Mighty Forces to Transform Your Life Forever</h2><p>Based on the teachings of the 12 archangels of Atlantis, this spiritual resource reveals how to become aligned with their power and wisdom.

Eugene McCarraher reveals how mammon ensnared us and how we can find a more humane, sacramental way of being in the world.</b></p><p>If socialists and Wall Street bankers can agree on anything, it is the extreme rationalism of capital. At least since Max Weber, capitalism has been understood as part of the &#x201c;disenchantment&#x201d; of the world, stripping material objects and social relations of their mystery and sacredness. Ignoring the motive force of the spirit, capitalism rejects the awe-inspiring divine for the economics of supply and demand.</p><p>Eugene McCarraher challenges this conventional view. Capitalism, he argues, is full of sacrament, whether or not it is acknowledged. Capitalist enchantment first flowered in the fields and factories of England and was brought to America by Puritans and evangelicals whose doctrine made ample room for industry and profit. Later, the corporation was mystically animated with human personhood, to preside over the Fordist endeavor to build a heavenly city of mechanized production and communion. By the twenty-first century, capitalism has become thoroughly enchanted by the neoliberal deification of &#x201c;the market.&#x201d;</p><p>Informed by cultural history and theology as well as economics, management theory, and marketing, <i>The Enchantments of Mammon</i> looks not to Marx and progressivism but to nineteenth-century Romantics for salvation. The Romantic imagination favors craft, the commons, and sensitivity to natural wonder. It promotes labor that, for the sake of the person, combines reason, creativity, and mutual aid. In this impassioned challenge, McCarraher makes the case that capitalism has hijacked and redirected our intrinsic longing for divinity&#x2015;and urges us to break its hold on our souls.</p></p><p>Eugene McCarraher is Associate Professor of Humanities at Villanova University and the author of <i>Christian Critics: Religion and the Impasse in Modern American Social Thought</i>. He has written for <i>Dissent</i> and <i>The Nation</i> and contributes regularly to <i>Commonweal</i>, <i>The Hedgehog Review</i>, and <i>Raritan</i>. His work on <i>The Enchantments of Mammon</i> was supported by fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies.&#x201c;<i>The Enchantments of Mammon</i> is a beautiful, stirring achievement. In a bold new synthesis ranging from early modern Europe to the contemporary United States, McCarraher challenges the received wisdom regarding the meanings of modernity and rationality, allowing us to look at familiar concepts in fresh and fruitful ways. This is truly a game-changer&#x2015;the history of capitalism will never look the same again.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jackson Lears, author of <i>Rebirth of a Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With this book McCarraher aspires to nothing less than a history of the soul under capitalism. Far from living in a secular, disenchanted world, he argues, ours is a world of &#x2018;misenchantment,&#x2019; in which longings for communion are perverted into a religion of plunder and technological control. Capitalism emerges here not as a system of market exchange or class domination but as an affront to the divine creation of which we are a part. An astonishing work of history and criticism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Casey Nelson Blake, author of <i>The Arts of Democracy</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An intellectually ambitious, analytically insightful, engagingly well written, and unfashionably radical yet timely study of the relationship among capitalism, religion, society, and culture in the United States. McCarraher argues that modern capitalism has not been a secularizing movement from enchantment to disenchantment, but rather an alternative, competing form of enchantment. He is sharply critical of the underlying assumptions and damaging consequences of modern capitalism with its emphasis on extractive efficiency and profit-making. A powerful, impressive work.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Brad Gregory, author of <i>The Unintended Reformation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A tour de force. McCarraher argues that capitalism is a successor faith, rather than a successor <i>to</i> faith. The capitalist faith in this telling is a heretical, blaspheming Black Mass of perverse sacramentality that sanctions domination by pretending to the status of immutable, impersonal laws of nature. In the world of economic enchantment masquerading as hard-eyed realism, McCarraher urges us to keep open an imaginative window through which to glimpse alternatives. His magnificent intellectual history recovers many such opportunities and invites us to appraise them with fresh eyes.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bethany Moreton, author of <i>To Serve God and Wal-Mart</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Surveying the history of capitalism from seventeenth-century England to the mid-twentieth-century United States, McCarraher argues in this magisterial work that capitalism is a corruption of the sacramental nature of the world and our desire to flourish within it. The keenest insights and best hopes for a more humane world reside not within secular traditions but within the Romantic lineage of joy and participation. <i>The Enchantments of Mammon</i> is a towering achievement: an exquisitely crafted refusal of the metaphysics of the free market and reassurance that the conditions of human flourishing are well within our reach.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Charles Marsh, author of <i>Strange Glory: A Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer </i></b><br><br>&#x201c;One of the most impressive books I&#x2019;ve ever read...The depth and range of McCarraher&#x2019;s scholarship are incredible...A must-read for anyone serious about the mesmerizing power of capitalism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mark Dunbar</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Humanist</i></b></p><h2>Yoga: Discipline of Freedom: The Yoga Sutra Attributed to Patanjali</h2><p>Dating from about the third century A.D., the <i>Yoga Sutra</i> distills the essence of the physical and spiritual discipline of yoga into fewer than two hundred brief aphorisms. It is the core text for any study of meditative practice, revered for centuries for its brilliant analysis of mental states and of the process by which inner liberation is achieved. Yet its difficulties are legendary, and until now, no translation has made it fully accessible. <br><br>This new translation, hailed by <i>Yoga Journal</i> for its "unsurpassed readability," is by one of the leading Sanskrit scholars of our time, whose <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> has become a recognized classic.

One afternoon, Brunetti gets a frantic call from the director of a prestigious Venetian library. Someone has stolen pages out of several rare books. After a round of questioning, the case seems clear: the culprit must be the man who requested the volumes, a visiting American professor. But the man fled the library earlier that day, and after checking his credentials, it becomes clear that he is not who he said he was. As the investigation proceeds, the suspects multiply. And when a seemingly harmless character turns up brutally murdered, Brunetti must question his expectations about what makes a man innocent, or guilty.</p><p><b>Donna Leon</b> is the author of the internationally bestselling Commissario Guido Brunetti series.

In <em>Kingdom of Nauvoo</em>, Benjamin E. Park excavates the brief, tragic life of a lost Mormon city, demonstrating that the Mormons are essential to understanding American history writ large. Using newly accessible sources, Park recreates the Mormons&#x2019; 1839 flight from Missouri to Illinois. There, under the charismatic leadership of Joseph Smith, they founded Nauvoo, which shimmered briefly&#x2015;but Smith&#x2019;s challenge to democratic traditions, as well as his new doctrine of polygamy, would bring about its fall. His wife Emma, rarely written about, opposed him, but the greater threat came from without: in 1844, a mob murdered Joseph, precipitating the Mormon trek to Utah. Throughout his absorbing chronicle, Park shows that far from being outsiders, the Mormons were representative of their era in their distrust of democracy and their attempt to forge a sovereign society of their own.</p> 35 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Benjamin E.

His first fifty or so years were pretty good. He felt he had it all, until one day he didn&#x2019;t. Seeking understanding, he calls on Volya Rinpoche, a wise man and spiritual leader. A man who accepts the world as it comes to him, a man without pride or vanity. But Rinpoche, as it turns out, is experiencing his own time of doubt. In hopes of finding answers to life&#x2019;s mysteries, the two embark on a journey through America, an amusing and enlightening road trip that becomes a lesson in love and gratitude.</p><p><b>Roland Merullo reflects on the "Buddha" trilogy</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>What started out as a simple road trip from New York to North Dakota has evolved into a trilogy -- <i>Breakfast with Buddha, Lunch with Buddha, </i>and, soon,<i> Dinner with Buddha. </i>In <i>Breakfast, </i>my original intention was to introduce an ordinary American, Otto Ringling, to the wisdom of the East, especially their emphasis on meditation and contemplation. Once I got started along that path, though, I realized that I'd have to walk with him (or, I guess, <i>ride </i>with him, since they are all road-trip books) deeper into the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes discouraging forest of a true spiritual life.<br><br>I wanted him to have a deepening understanding of himself and of the world he inhabits. In order to do that, I needed to take him through love as well as loss and epiphany as well as disappointment. And, since I see these novels, also, as observations on modern American life, I wanted him to see other parts of this great nation. <i>Lunch </i>takes him and Rinpoche (and sometimes other family members) from Seattle to North Dakota. <i>Dinner </i>takes them from North Dakota, through the West's wide-open spaces, and deposits them in a city not exactly known for its emphasis on things spiritual.<br><br>Though all three books have a spiritual/philosophical core, I'm not out to preach or convert. What I try to do is to explore the larger questions of meaning without simply repeating the tenets of any one faith. I want to take a common-sense look at life, American life especially, a balanced, original, thought-provoking look. Like most of us, Otto is steeped in a Western way of thinking about the world. His is an exterior philosophy: be a good husband, father, and citizen; do no harm, and if there is an afterlife, you will be rewarded. The Eastern way -- best stated, perhaps, by Jesus' line "the kingdom of heaven is within you" -- focuses more on the interior world, on the working of the mind and the techniques one might use to change those patterns that are damaging or unhelpful.<br><br>In <i>Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner, </i>I worked to strike a balance between those two world-views, letting Otto keep some of his practical, Midwestern ethics, but also letting him gradually open himself to Rinpoche's focus on the "thought stream", on things interior.<br><br>It can be weighty material. I understood that going into the first book and so I did everything I could to make the story strong enough, the characters interesting enough, and the book itself funny enough that it wouldn't come close to the dangerous territory of pious preachery (my word). <br><br>The response so far has been absolutely surprisingly wonderful. Six years after its publication, <i>Breakfast </i>continues to sell and continues to be a book club favorite. <i>Lunch, </i>still in its early childhood, shows every sign of following in its older cousin's footsteps. <i>Dinner </i>will be out in the spring of 2015.<br><br>I can't see myself going on and on after this trilogy is all in print. But I do have to admit to considering one more piece of Otto's spiritual path, one last step that I need to put him through. I welcome suggestions for a title, but I think that fourth book will be something a little bit different, not an American road trip at all.

She presents extensive new evidence about the Putin circle&#x2019;s use of public positions for personal gain even before Putin became president in 2000. She documents the establishment of Bank Rossiya, now sanctioned by the US; the rise of the Ozero cooperative, founded by Putin and others who are now subject to visa bans and asset freezes; the links between Putin, Petromed, and &#x201c;Putin&#x2019;s Palace&#x201d; near Sochi; and the role of security officials from Putin&#x2019;s KGB days in Leningrad and Dresden, many of whom have maintained their contacts with Russian organized crime.<br> <br><i>Putin&#x2019;s Kleptocracy</i> is the result of years of research into the KGB and the various Russian crime syndicates. Dawisha&#x2019;s sources include Stasi archives; Russian insiders; investigative journalists in the US, Britain, Germany, Finland, France, and Italy; and Western officials who served in Moscow. Russian journalists wrote part of this story when the Russian media was still free. &#x201c;Many of them died for this story, and their work has largely been scrubbed from the Internet, and even from Russian libraries,&#x201d; Dawisha says. &#x201c;But some of that work remains.&#x201d;</p><p>Karen Dawisha is the Walter E. Havighurst Professor of Political Science in the Department of Political Science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and the director of the University&#x2019;s Havighurst Center for Russian and Post-Soviet Studies. She has written five previous books, eight edited volumes, and numerous journal articles, and continues to do research and teaching in the areas of post-communist transitions and Russian politics.Putin&#x2019;s Kleptocracy Chapter One<p></p> <br><br> The USSR at the Moment of Collapse<p></p> <br>IN DECEMBER 2012, in a judicial hearing in London into the death of Aleksandr Litvinenko, a former operative for the Russian FSB who for some time had been a virulent critic of President Vladimir Putin, Hugh Davies, the counsel to the inquest, stated that evidence possessed by the British government established &#x201c;a prima facie case in the culpability of the Russian state in the death of Alexander Litvinenko.&#x201d;1 In July 2014, as relations with Russia deteriorated, British prime minister David Cameron announced he would let the public inquest proceed. At the center of the inquiry was a claim by Litvinenko&#x2019;s widow that, at the time of his 2006 death by polonium-210 poisoning, he was providing evidence to Spanish authorities about &#x201c;Russian mafia links to the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin.&#x201d;2<br> <br>The inquest pointed to the tangled web of relations between the Russian state and the mafia, relations that were known to Western governments and much discussed in U.S. cables released by Wikileaks. In particular, a series of events in Spain underlined what had become an interlocking network of associations and clan-based politics centered on Putin. First there was the arrest in Spain in 2008 of the reputed leaders of the St. Petersburg&#x2013;based Tambov-Malyshev organized crime group,I including Gennadiy Petrov and Aleksandr Malyshev. Then there was the warrant for the arrest of Vladislav Reznik, who was the cochairman of the ruling United Russia Party and chairman of the Duma&#x2019;s Finance Committee.3, II Finally, there was the revelation that Communications Minister Leonid Reyman owned a beachfront house in the same resort in Majorca as Petrov, who introduced him to potential Spanish partners, and that Reyman himself was under investigation by Spanish authorities.5<br> <br>All those under investigation in Spain came from St. Petersburg, and all were close associates of Putin, as they rose up together from the early 1990s onward. This incident goes to the heart of whether, as Spanish prosecutors stated in classified briefings to U.S. and other Western governments, made public via Wikileaks, Russia under Putin had become a virtual &#x201c;mafia state&#x201d;6 in which state structures operate hand in glove with criminal structures to their mutual benefit, with the mafia operating within guidelines established by top Kremlin elites for the purpose of strengthening Putin&#x2019;s hold on power, silencing critics, and maximizing mutual economic benefits.<br> <br>Briefing U.S. officials behind closed doors, the Spanish prosecutor called Russia, Chechnya, and Belarus &#x201c;mafia states&#x201d; and stated that in such countries &#x201c;one cannot differentiate between the activities of the government and OC [organized crime] groups.&#x201d; Further, the security services &#x201c;control OC in Russia.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The FSB is &#x2018;absorbing&#x2019; the Russia mafia&#x201d; and using them for black operations as a price for operating on Russian territory. But at the same time, the prosecutor told U.S. officials, Russian organized crime responds to pressure by taking advantage of &#x201c;the corruption of high-level ministers.&#x201d; Extensive wiretaps showed that these Russian organized crime leaders had a &#x201c; &#x2018;dangerously close&#x2019; level of contact with senior Russian officials.&#x201d;7 The secret cable reported Spanish press allegations that the Spanish government had compiled a list of Russian procurators, senior military officers, and politicians, including current and former ministers, who were involved with Petrov and Russian organized crime. The list included at least four sitting ministers, including the Russian minister of defense at that time, Anatoliy Serdyukov, who was notable for his &#x201c;very close ties&#x201d; to Petrov.8 The cable that was released also referenced other classified lists of compromised officials that were not part of the Wikileaks documents but indicate that the U.S. government has had a very specific idea of the officials involved in links between the Russian government and Russian organized crime since at least 2008.III<br> <br>The questions arising from this fascinating story are many: What kind of system has Putin created? When did these plans emerge? Who is at the center of them along with Putin? What kind of control does Putin have over the plans themselves? I suggest that the antidemocratic and politically illiberal aspects of the plans were present from the beginning, as were the efforts to create a liberal economic system that would allow Russians to enjoy the fruits of their labors more than at any time in their history. The plan was always that those closest to power would be in a position to enjoy those fruits on an unprecedented scale. The story starts when the Soviet Union was still standing, if declining, in the 1970s and 1980s.<br> <br>Beginning in the 1970s, when the Soviet leadership started to enter the world economy to sell oil in exchange for technology (some of it bought illegally at high prices) and grain to offset the structural problems in their own economy, they began to accumulate funds in hard currency abroad. Conflicts in the Middle East quadrupled the price of oil in the 1970s, thus massively increasing the amounts in Soviet overseas accounts. These accounts were under the strict day-to-day control of the KGB and were used to fund foreign operations, underwrite friendly parties and movements, and purchase goods for import. The strategic decisions about how the money would be spent were made by the Communist Party hierarchy, while the KGB was in charge of implementation. However, under Soviet president Mikhayl Gorbachev there is reason to think that the KGB declined to repatriate funds and only increased the economic crisis of a leadership in which they had no confidence. Indeed even more funds began to flood out of the USSR in the late 1980s for safekeeping abroad. As one well-placed Russian cooperative owner observed in 1989, &#x201c;The West thinks the KGB is gone. They [the KGB] are no longer concerned with investigating people, but they are very involved in destabilizing perestroika. Last week the KGB created a new division of forty agents to do nothing but start joint ventures with Western firms. This is their experimental sociological work. If the crowds rush in tomorrow to kill Gorbachev, the KGB will do nothing because they are concentrating on their scientific experiments.&#x201d;9<br> <br>When the newly elected Russian president Boris Yel&#x2019;tsin banned the CPSU after the failed 1991 August coup against Gorbachev, the CPSU&#x2019;s guidance ceased, and the control over this vast mountain of foreign money fell to KGB agents who had access to foreign operations and accounts. Some of the money stayed abroad and disappeared, but when the USSR collapsed and assets became available for purchase inside the country, this money was available for investment to those who controlled the accounts. Thus were born, it is estimated, most of Russia&#x2019;s oligarchs and commercial banks. By the early 1990s KGB veterans who knew the details of these accounts needed like-minded officials in key positions who could help control who would get to invest in Russia and who would not.10 For this they found willing allies among the KGB and Party veterans who flooded into the new cooperative movement in the late 1980s11 and who then sought to build capitalism, enrich themselves, and control market entry. Among these was the rather more junior KGB official Vladimir Putin. And in trying to control what kind of economy would emerge, they were up against a formidable and historic collapse.<br> <br>Some people visualize Russia in the late 1990s as a country that went through a &#x201c;Wild West&#x201d; period, or something similar to Al Capone&#x2019;s reign in Chicago. But in 1999 a prominent expert stated in testimony before the U.S. Congress:<br> <br>For the U.S. to be like Russia is today, it would be necessary to have massive corruption by the majority of the members of Congress as well as by the Departments of Justice and Treasury, and agents of the FBI, CIA, DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency], IRS, Marshal Service, Border Patrol, state and local police officers, the Federal Reserve Bank, Supreme Court justices, U.S. District court judges, support of the varied Organized Crime families, the leadership of the Fortune 500 companies, at least half of the banks in the U.S., and the New York Stock Exchange. This cabal would then have to seize the gold at Fort Knox and the federal assets deposited in the entire banking system. It would have to take control of the key industries such as oil, natural gas, mining, precious and semi-precious metals, forestry, cotton, construction, insurance, and banking industries&#x2014;and then claim these items to be their private property. The legal system would have to nullify most of the key provisions against corruption, conflict of interest, criminal conspiracy, money laundering, economic fraud and weaken tax evasion laws. This unholy alliance would then have to spend about 50% of its billions in profits to bribe officials that remained in government and be the primary supporters of all of the political candidates. Then, most of the stolen funds, excess profits and bribes would have to be sent to off-shore banks for safekeeping. Finally, while claiming that the country was literally bankrupt and needed vast infusions of foreign aid to survive, this conspiratorial group would invest billions in spreading illegal activities to developed foreign countries.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The President would not only be aware of all these activities but would support them.12<br> <br>This statement was made in testimony to the U.S. House Committee on Banking and Financial Services by Richard L. Palmer, who had been CIA chief of base and chief of station in countries of the former Soviet Union. When Palmer gave his testimony in September 1999, Putin was not yet president, but he was prime minister, he had been head of the successor organization to the KGB, the Federal Security Service, and he had been investigated on a number of occasions for high-level corruption and criminal activity.<br> <br>Of course, there were those in the Russian government who were aware of the problem and had tried to correct it. On February 18, 1992, for example, the Yel&#x2019;tsin-Gaidar government signed an agreement with an American corporate private investigation firm, Kroll Associates, to track down and help repatriate money illegally held or taken abroad by former Communist Party and Soviet government agencies, including the KGB. The money had allegedly left the country prior to the August 1991 attempted coup against the reformist-oriented Gorbachev by conservatives in the highest echelons of the ruling Communist Party and the KGB.13 A group of Central Committee officials, including the head of the Party department dealing with the defense industry, the head of state television and radio, and the deputy head of the committee in charge of privatizing state property, were all dismissed after revelations about their involvement in embezzlement and capital flight. Several of them had also been involved in efforts during the Gorbachev period by a so-called patriotic wing of the special services to organize various provocations to undermine Gorbachev and prove that his reforms needed to be halted. Yegor Gaidar, who at that time was the minister of finance, stated that this kind of activity was not only illegal but constituted continued political resistance to the government&#x2019;s economic reform efforts: &#x201c;Last year saw large-scale privatization by the nomenklatura [the high-ranking elite], privatization by officials for their own personal benefit.&#x201d;14 The New York Times reported that the office of the Russian procurator general had been &#x201c;unable to penetrate the maze of hidden bank accounts and secret investments, left behind by party officials acting in some cases&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with the cooperation of the K.G.B.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One estimate for the party&#x2019;s hidden assets is $50 billion.&#x201d;15 Kroll, which had also led the hunt for stolen funds from the Marcos regime in the Philippines and Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s invasion of Kuwait, was reported to have &#x201c;found that thousands of mostly offshore bank accounts, real estate holdings and offshore companies had been set up to launder and shelter these funds and what had been the Soviet Union&#x2019;s gold reserves.&#x201d;16, IV<br> <br>In response to this report and their own investigations, the Yel&#x2019;tsin government passed a law giving it the right to confiscate funds taken abroad illegally. Yel&#x2019;tsin was receiving monthly updates from Kroll; the lower house of the Russian Supreme Soviet, the Council of Nationalities (as it was called until December 1993), demanded that the Foreign Intelligence ServiceV provide a report on Kroll&#x2019;s progress, which Izvestiya reported was provided in a closed session by First Deputy Director Vyacheslav Trubnikov.18 The Supreme Soviet Presidium had decreed that a special commission be established by the procurator general to investigate corruption, abuse of power, and economic offenses. Its report was presented to the Supreme Soviet in September 1993. In it Kroll&#x2019;s efforts were noted; the document recounted widespread instances of &#x201c;bribery of officials, blackmail, and the illegal transfer of currency resources to foreign banks,&#x201d; with specific ministers sanctioned by name, including Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Pyotr Aven (whose activities in approving Putin&#x2019;s early contracts as head of the St. Petersburg Committee for Foreign LiaisonVI are dealt with below). The report also criticized the Ministry of Security (the precursor of the FSB) for the fact that while it had opened three hundred investigations in the first six months of 1993 alone, only &#x201c;two criminal cases had been instituted in practice.&#x201d;19 In theory, in both Yel&#x2019;tsin&#x2019;s camp and in the Communist-dominated legislature, everyone was seeking to stanch the flow. But nothing happened in practice. As one of Kroll&#x2019;s investigators stated, the report raised &#x201c;suspicions about certain players and institutions [in the former Soviet Union]. Our problem is that when we sent it to Moscow, it was never followed up.&#x201d;20<br> <br>This image of high-level culpability was reinforced when U.S. law enforcement intercepted telephone calls in the United States from the highest officials in President Yel&#x2019;tsin&#x2019;s office, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin&#x2019;s staff, and other ministers to and from the head of the Russian firm Golden ADA, established in San Francisco, linking the firm to various scams that collectively added up to almost $1 billion.21 The size of the scams is suggested by the fact that in 1994 Golden ADA had a declared taxable income in the United States of $111,485,984, according to U.S. court documents.22 FBI records show that the FBI turned over to Russia information linking Golden ADA with Yevgeniy Bychkov, the chairman of the Russian Committee for Precious Gems and Metals, and Igor Moskovskiy, a deputy minister of finance. Eventually, in 2001, with documents provided by FBI wiretaps, as the FBI website wryly states, both &#x201c;were convicted of abusing their state positions and immediately granted Stat...</p><h2>The McElderry Book of Greek Myths (Margaret K.

If you're not white, it's the depth and breadth of that white culture that either pushes you to the side or inspires you to push back.

That season more than 100 Aggie hopefuls arrived in the small town of Junction for the first practice of a now legendary training camp. The sun bore down. The drills escalated. Trainers doled out water like gold, and meals and accommodations were horribly spartan. Ten hellish days later, only 34 remained to form the 1954 team that would only win one game, but those survivors--and that's what they were--formed the nucleus of the squad that would go undefeated just two years later. <p> This is the story of that team, that coach, the 10 days that shook their world, and the seasons they played together. "We lost alot (sic) of games," recalls Gene Stallings, who endured those days as a player and eventually followed Bryant as head coach both at A&amp;M and Alabama, "but Coach Bryant knew what he was doing. Out of the yellow dust and the broiling heat of Junction, he forged a team of champions." Jim Dent's evocative recounting is so real and immediate you'll feel your throat getting scratchy as you read. You'll also feel remarkable respect for the players who toughed it out--and for Bryant, who begins as a man possessed, but, day after day, as he breaks the backs of some and helps instill true grit in others, transforms into a human being. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>The legendary Paul "Bear" Bryant is recognized nationwide as one of the greatest coaches ever. So why did he always cite his 1-9 A&amp;M team of 1954 as his favorite? This is the story of a remarkable team - and the beginning of the legend.<p> In August of fifty-four, the town of Junction was a flyspeck on the map of Texas. The Texas Hill Country was in the grip of a five-year drought that had fried most of central and West Texas. On a day late in the month, two Greyhound buses weaved through a twisting and narrow two-lane highway. The Texas A&amp;M football team aboard, 111 strong, would soon arrive in a tiny town with no stoplights, one service station, and precious little else; just outside town, they would find an unforgiving patch of land littered with spartan Quonset huts, rocks, sandspurs, cactus, yellow dust and gnarled mesquite trees.</p><p> As Texas suffered from the devastating drought, so to did Texas A&amp;M football suffer from a drought of heart and talent. To the rescue came Bear Bryant, already a legend in the making, who was in no mood for a picnic. It was in Junction that he would make his stand, and it was here that he would drive home an extreme brand of blood-and-thunder discipline. In a calculated move that many consider the salvation of Texas A&amp;M football, Bryant put his players through the most grueling workouts ever imagined. Beneath a broiling Texas sun, practicing on a drought-scorched field, only a handful would survive the ten-day Aggie Death Camp. The ones who braved the torch-like heat and the burning passion of their coach helped turn a floundering team into one of the nation's best. </p><p> <i>The Junction Boys</i> recounts this training camp and the rebuilding program that culminated in an undefeated season just three years later. But this is more than just a story of tough practices without water breaks. An extraordinary fellowship was forged from the mind-numbing pain. The thirty-five survivors bonded together like no other team in America. They profited from the Junction experience; the knowledge they took back with them to College Station, about themselves and what they were capable of, would be used for the rest of their lives. Among the Junction survivors who would have a powerful influence on the game of football were Gene Stallings and Jack Pardee. </p><p> In vivid and powerful images reminiscent of <i>Friday Night Lights, Hoosiers</i>, and <i>The Last Picture Show</i>, these young men and their driven coach come to life. <i>The Junction Boys</i> contains all the hallmarks of a classic sports story, and it combines America's love of college football with an extraordinary story of perseverance and triumph.</p></p><h2>Tuxedo Park : A Wall Street Tycoon and the Secret Palace of Science That Changed the Course of World War II</h2><p>The untold story of an eccentric Wall Street tycoon and the circle of scientific geniuses he assembled before World War II to develop the science for radar and the atomic bomb. Together they changed the course of history.<br><br>Legendary financier, philanthropist, and society figure Alfred Lee Loomis gathered the most visionary scientific minds of the twentieth century&#x2014;Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi, and others&#x2014;at his state-of-the-art laboratory in Tuxedo Park, New York, in the late 1930s. He established a top-secret defense laboratory at MIT and personally bankrolled pioneering research into new, high-powered radar detection systems that helped defeat the German Air Force and U-boats. With Ernest Lawrence, the Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning physicist, he pushed Franklin Delano Roosevelt to fund research in nuclear fission, which led to the development of the atomic bomb. <br><br>Jennet Conant, the granddaughter of James Bryant Conant, one of the leading scientific advisers of World War II, enjoyed unprecedented access to Loomis&#x2019; papers, as well as to people intimately involved in his life and work. She pierces through Loomis&#x2019; obsessive secrecy and illuminates his role in assuring the Allied victory.</p><p>This must have been an extremely difficult book to write. Its subject, Alfred Loomis, never gave interviews during his lifetime and destroyed all his papers before his death. "Few men of Loomis' prominence and achievement have gone to greater lengths to foil history," writes author Jennet Conant. Had he not done these things, his name would be better known--and this probably wouldn't be the first biography about him. So who was Alfred Loomis? "He was too complex to categorize--financier, philanthropist, society figure, physicist, inventor, amateur, dilettante--a contradiction in terms," writes Conant. Loomis established a private laboratory in New York and hired scientists whose work in the 1930s wound up making possible both the radar and the atomic bomb. These developments were essential to Allied victory in the Second World War. Conant is perhaps the only person who could have pierced Loomis's obsessive secrecy and written this book; she grew up with Loomis's children and other members of his family. Her grandfather, Harvard president James Bryant Conant, was one of Loomis's scientists. <i>Tuxedo Park</i> is an important book about the development of military technology in the United States; admirers of <i>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</i> by Richard Rhodes and similar titles won't want to miss it. <i>--John Miller</i>Jennet Conant is the author of&nbsp;<i>Man of the Hour: James B.

Begun in the late 1940s by an international team of New Testament scholars, the NICNT series has become recognized by pastors, students, and scholars alike as a critical yet orthodox commentary marked by solid biblical scholarship within the evangelical Protestant tradition.<br><br>While based on a thorough study of the Greek text, the commentary introductions and expositions contain a minimum of Greek references. The NICNT authors evaluate significant textual problems and take into account the most important exegetical literature. More technical aspects &#x2014; such as grammatical, textual, and historical problems &#x2014; are dealt with in footnotes, special notes, and appendixes.<br><br>Under the general editorship of three outstanding New Testament scholars &#x2014; first Ned Stonehouse (Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia), then F. F. Bruce (University of Manchester, England), and now Gordon D. Fee (Regent College, Vancouver, British Columbia) &#x2014; the NICNT series has continued to develop over the years. In order to keep the commentary &#x201c;new&#x201d; and conversant with contemporary scholarship, the NICNT volumes have been &#x2014; and will be &#x2014; revised or replaced as necessary.<br><br>The newer NICNT volumes in particular take into account the role of recent rhetorical and sociological inquiry in elucidating the meaning of the text, and they also exhibit concern for the theology and application of the text. As the NICNT series is ever brought up to date, it will continue to find ongoing usefulness as an established guide to the New Testament text.</p><p>This commentary by respected New Testament scholar Gordon D. Fee is a scholarly yet thoroughly readable study of Paul&#39;s letter to the suffering community of believers in Philippi. Working directly from the Greek text but basing his comments on the New International Version, Fee sets Paul&#39;s letter to the Philippians squarely within the context of first-century &#34;friendship&#34; and &#34;moral exhortation&#34; to a church facing opposition because of its loyalty to Jesus Christ. At the same time Fee gives equal concern to the letter&#39;s theological and spiritual relevance. Important features of this commentary include a remarkable comparison of Philippians to two well-known types of letters in the Greco-Roman world: the letter of friendship and the letter of moral exhortation; an introduction that discusses the occasion, authenticity, and theological contributions of Philippians; and scholarly insights that resolve many of the formal and structural issues that have long puzzled New Testament scholars.Gordon D. Fee is professor emeritus of New Testament studies at Regent College, Vancouver, and general editor of the New International Commentary on the New Testament series.</p><h2>The Thief and the Dogs</h2><p><p>Naguib Mahfouz's haunting novella of post-revolutionary Egypt combines a vivid pychological portrait of an anguished man with the suspense and rapid pace of a detective story.</p><p>After four years in prison, the skilled young thief Said Mahran emerges bent on revenge. He finds a world that has changed in more ways than one. Egypt has undergone a revolution and, on a more personal level, his beloved wife and his trusted henchman, who conspired to betray him to the police, are now married to each other and are keeping his six-year-old daughter from him. But in the most bitter betrayal, his mentor, Rauf Ilwan, once a firebrand revolutionary who convinced Said that stealing from the rich in a unjust society is an act of justice, is now himself a rich man, a respected newspaper editor who wants nothing to do with the disgraced Said. As Said's wild attempts to achieve his idea of justice badly misfire, he becomes a hunted man so driven by hatred that he can only recognize too late his last chance at redemption.</p></p><p><p>Naguib Mahfouz was born in Cairo in 1911 and began writing when he was seventeen. His nearly forty novels and hundreds of short stories range from re-imaginings of ancient myths to subtle commentaries on contemporary Egyptian politics and culture. Of his many works, most famous is The Cairo Trilogy, consisting of <i>Palace Walk</i> (1956), <i>Palace of Desire</i> (1957), and <i>Sugar Street</i> (1957), which focuses on a Cairo family through three generations, from 1917 until 1952. In 1988, he was the first writer in Arabic to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He died in August 2006.</p>ONEOnce more he breathed the air of freedom. But there was stifling dust in the air, almost unbearable heat, and no one was waiting for him; nothing but his blue suit and gym shoes.As the prison gate and its unconfessable miseries receded, the world--streets belabored by the sun, careening cars, crowds of people moving or still--returned.No one smiled or seemed happy. But who of these people could have suffered more than he had, with four years lost, taken from him by betrayal? And the hour was coming when he would confront them, when his rage would explode and burn, when those who had betrayed him would despair unto death, when treachery would pay for what it had done.Nabawiyya. Ilish. Your two names merge in my mind. For years you will have been thinking about this day, never imagining, all the while, that the gates would ever actually open. You&#39;ll be watching now, but I won&#39;t fall into the trap. At the right moment, instead, I&#39;ll strike like Fate.And Sana? What about Sana?As the thought of her crossed his mind, the heat and the dust, the hatred and pain all disappeared, leaving only love to glow across a soul as clear as a rain-washed sky.I wonder how much the little one even knows about her father? Nothing, I suppose. No more than this road does, these passersby or this molten air.She had never been out of his thoughts, where bit by bit she&#39;d taken shape, like an image in a dream, for four long years. Would luck now give him some decent place to live, where such love could be equally shared, where he could take joy in being a winner again, where what Nabawiyya Ilish had done would be no more than a memory, odious, but almost forgotten?You must pull together all the cunning you possess, to culminate in a blow as powerful as your endurance behind prison walls. Here is a man--a man who can dive like a fish, fly like a hawk, scale walls like a rat, pierce solid doors like a bullet!How will he look when he first sees you? How will his eyes meet yours? Have you forgotten, Ilish, how you used to rub against my legs like a dog? It was me, wasn&#39;t it, who taught you how to stand on your own two feet, who made a man of a cigarette-butt cadger? You&#39;ve forgotten, Ilish, and you&#39;re not the only one: She&#39;s forgotten, too, that woman who sprang from filth, from vermin, from treachery and infidelity.Through all this darkness only your face, Sana, smiles. When we meet I&#39;ll know how I stand. In a little while, as soon as I&#39;ve covered the length of this road, gone past all these gloomy arcades, where people used to have fun. Onward and upward. But not to glory. I swear I hate you all.The bars have shut down and only the side streets are open, where plots are hatched From time to time he has to cross over a hole in the pavement set there like a snare and the wheels of streetcars growl and shriek like abuse. Confused cries seem to seep from the curbside garbage. (1 swear I hate you all.) Houses of temptation, their windows beckoning even when eyeless, walls scowling where plaster has fallen. And that strange lane, al-Sayrafi Lane, which brings back dark memories. Where the thief stole, then vanished, whisked away. (Woe to the traitors.) Where police who&#39;d staked out the area had slithered in to surround you.The same little street where a year before you&#39;d been carrying home flour to make sweetmeats for the Feast, that woman walking in front of you, carrying Sana in her swaddling clothes. Glorious days--how real they were, no one knows--the Feast, love, parenthood, crime. All mixed up with this spot.The great mosques and, beyond them, the Citadel against the clear sky, then the road flowing into the square, where the green park lies under the hot sun and a dry breeze blows, refreshing despite the heat--the Citadel square, with all its burning recollections.What&#39;s important now is to make your face relax, to pour a little cold water over your feelings, to appear friendly and conciliatory, to play the planned role well. He crossed the middle of the square, entered Imam Way, and walked along it until he came close to the three-story house at the end, where two little streets joined the main road. This social visit will tell you what they&#39;ve got up their sleeves. So study the road carefully, and what&#39;s on it. Those shops, for instance, where the men are staring at you, cowering like mice.&#34;Said Mahran!&#34; said a voice behind him. &#34;How marvelous!&#34;He let the man catch up with him; they said hello to each other, hiding their real feelings under mutual grins. So the bastard has friends. He&#39;ll know right away what all these greetings are about. You&#39;re probably peeking at us through the shutters now, Ilish, hiding like a woman.&#34;I thank you, Mr. Bayaza.&#34;People came up to them from the shops on both sides of the street; voices were loud and warm in congratulation and Said found himself surrounded by a crowd--his enemy&#39;s friends, no doubt--who tried to outdo one another in cordiality.&#34;Thank God you&#39;re back safe and sound.&#34;&#34;All of us, your close friends, are overjoyed!&#34;&#34;We all said we wished you&#39;d be released on the anniversary of the Revolution.&#34;&#34;I thank God and you, gentlemen,&#34; he said, staring at them with his brown, almond-shaped eyes.Bayaza patted him on the shoulder. &#34;Come into the shop and have a cold drink to celebrate.&#34;&#34;Later,&#34; he said quietly. &#34;When I&#39;m back.&#34;&#34;Back?&#34;One man shouts, directing his voice to the second story of the house: &#34;Mr. Ilish! Mr. Ilish, come down and congratulate Said Mahran!&#34; No need to warn him, you black beetle! I&#39;ve come in broad daylight. I know you&#39;ve been watching.&#34;Back from what?&#34; said Bayaza.&#34;There&#39;s some business I have to settle.&#34;&#34;With whom?&#34; said Bayaza.&#34;Have you forgotten I&#39;m a father? And that my little girl&#39;s with Ilish?&#34;&#34;No. But there&#39;s a solution to every disagreement. In the sacred law.&#34;&#34;And it&#39;s best to reach an understanding,&#34; said someone else.&#34;Said, you&#39;re fresh out of prison,&#34; a third man added in a conciliatory tone. &#34;A wise man learns his lesson.&#34;&#34;Who said I&#39;m here for anything other than to reach an understanding?&#34;On the second story of the building a window opened, Ilish leaned out, and they all looked up at him tensely. Before a word could be said, a big man wearing a striped garment and police boots came from the front door of the house. Said recognized Hasaballah, the detective, and pretended to be surprised.&#34;Don&#39;t get excited. I have come only to reach an amicable settlement,&#34; he said with feeling.The detective came up and patted him all over, searching with practiced speed and skill. &#34;Shut up, you cunning bastard. What did you say you wanted?&#34;&#34;I&#39;ve come to reach an understanding about the future of my daughter.&#34;&#34;As if you knew what understanding meant!&#34;&#34;I do indeed, for my daughter&#39;s sake.&#34;&#34;You can always go to court.&#34;Ilish shouted from above, &#34;Let him come up. Come up all of you. You&#39;re all welcome.&#34; Rally them round you, coward. I&#39;ve only come to test the strength of your fortifications. When your hour arrives, neither detective nor walls will do you any good.They all crowded into a sitting room and planted themselves in sofas and chairs. The windows were opened: flies rushed in with the light. Cigarette burns had made black spots in the sky-blue carpet and from a large photograph on the wall Ilish, holding a thick stick with both his hands, stared out on the room. The detective sat next to Said and began to play with his worry beads.Ilish Sidra came into the room, a loose garment swelling round his barrel-like body, his fat round face buttressed by a square chin. His huge nose had a broken bridge. &#34;Thank the Lord you&#39;re back safe and sound!&#34; he said, as if he had nothing to fear. But no one spoke, anxious looks passed back and forth, and the atmosphere was tense until Ilish continued: &#34;What&#39;s over is done with, these things happen every day; unhappiness can occur, and old friendships often break up. But only shameful deeds can shame a man.Conscious that his eyes were glittering, that he was slim and strong, Said felt like a tiger crouched to spring on an elephant. He found himself repeating Ilish&#39;s words: &#34;Only shameful deeds can shame a man.&#34; Many eyes stared back at him; the detective&#39;s fingers stopped playing with his beads; realizing what was passing in their minds, he added as an afterthought, &#34;I agree with every word you say.&#34;&#34;Come to the point,&#34; the detective broke in, &#34;and stop beating about the bush.&#34;&#34;Which point?&#34; Said said innocently.&#34;There&#39;s only one point to discuss, and that&#39;s your daughter.&#34;And what about my wife and my fortune, you mangy dogs! I&#39;ll show you. Just wait. How I&#39;d like to see now the look you&#39;ll have in your eyes. It would give me respect for beetles, scorpions, and worms, you vermin. Damn the man who lets himself be carried away by the melodious voice of woman. But Said nodded in agreement.One of the sycophants said, &#34;Your daughter is in safe hands with her mother. According to the law a six-year-old girl should stay with her mother. If you like, I could bring her to visit you every week.&#34;Said raised his voice deliberately, so that he could be heard outside the room: &#34;According to the law she should be in my custody. In view of the various circumstances.&#34;&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Ilish said, suddenly angry.&#34;Arguing will only give you a headache,&#34; said the detective, trying to placate him.&#34;I have committed no crime. It was partly fate and circumstances, partly my sense of duty and decency that drove me to do what I did. And I did it partly for the sake of the little girl.&#34;A sense of duty and decency, indeed, you snake! Double treachery, betrayal, and infidelity! Oh for the sledgehammer and the ax and the gallows rope! I wonder how Sana looks now. &#34;I did not leave her in need,&#34; Said said, as calmly as he could. &#34;She had my money, and plenty of it.&#34;&#34;You mean your loot,&#34; the detective roared, &#34;the existence of which you denied in court!&#34;&#34;All right, call it what you like. But where has it gone?&#34;&#34;There wasn&#39;t a penny, believe me, friends!&#34; Ilish protested loudly, &#34;She was in a terrible predicament. I just did my duty.&#34;&#34;Then how have you been able to live in such comfort,&#34; Said challenged, &#34;and spend so generously on others?&#34;&#34;Are you God, that you should call me to account?&#34;&#34;Peace, peace, shame the devil, Said,&#34; said one of Ilish&#39;s friends.&#34;I know you inside out, Said,&#34; the detective said slowly. &#34;I can read your thoughts better than anyone. You will only destroy yourself. Just stick to the subject of the girl. That&#39;s the best thing for you.&#34;Said looked down to hide his eyes, then smiled and said, in a tone of resignation, &#34;You&#39;re quite right, Officer.&#34;&#34;I know you inside out. But I&#39;ll go along with you. Out of consideration for the people here. Bring the girl, someone. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to find out first what she thinks?&#34;&#34;What do you mean, Officer?&#34;&#34;Said, I know you. You don&#39;t want the girl. And you can&#39;t keep her, because you&#39;ll have difficulty enough finding some accommodation for yourself. But it&#39;s only fair and kind to let you see her. Bring in the girl.&#34;Bring in her mother, you mean. How I wish our eyes could meet, so I might behold one of the secrets of hell! Oh for the ax and the sledgehammer!Ilish went to fetch the girl. At the sound of returning footsteps Said&#39;s heart began to beat almost painfully, and as he stared at the door, he bit the inside of his lips, anticipation and tenderness stifling all his rage.After what seemed a thousand years, the girl appeared. She looked surprised. She was wearing a smart white frock and white open slippers that showed henna-dyed toes. She gazed at him, her face dark, her black hair flowing over her forehead, while his soul devoured her. Bewildered, she looked around at all the other faces, then particularly at his, which was staring so intently. He was unable to take his eyes off her. As she felt herself being pushed toward him, she planted her feet on the carpet and leaned backward away from him. And suddenly he felt crushed by a sense of total loss.It was as if, in spite of her almond-shaped eyes, her long face, and her slender, aquiline nose, she was not his own daughter. Where were the instinctive ties of blood and soul? Were they, too, treacherous, deceptive? And how could he, even so, resist the almost overwhelming desire to hug her to him forever?&#34;This is your father, child,&#34; said the detective impatiently.&#34;Shake hands with Daddy,&#34; said Ilish, his face impassive.She&#39;s like a mouse. What&#39;s she afraid of? Doesn&#39;t she know how much I love her? He stretched out his hand toward her, but instead of being able to say anything he had a fit of choking and had to swallow hard, managing only to smile at her tenderly, invitingly.&#34;No!&#34; said Sana. She backed away, trying to steal out of the room, but a man standing behind stopped her. &#34;Mommy!&#34; she cried, but the man pushed her gently and said, &#34;Shake hands with Daddy.&#34; Everyone looked on with malicious interest.Said knew now that prison lashings had not been as cruel as he used to think. &#34;Come to me, Sana,&#34; he pleaded, unable to bear her refusal any longer, half standing and drawing closer to her.&#34;No!&#34; she shouted.&#34;I am your daddy.&#34; She raised her eyes to Ilish Sidra in bewilderment, but Said repeated emphatically, &#34;I am your daddy, come to me.&#34; She shrank back even further. He pulled her toward him almost forcibly. Then she screamed, and as he drew her closer, she fought back, crying. He leaned forward to kiss her, disregarding his failure and disappointment, but his lips caught only a whirling arm. &#34;I&#39;m your daddy. Don&#39;t be afraid. I&#39;m your dad.&#34; The scent on her hair filled his mind with the memory of her mother; he felt his face go hard. The child struggled and wept more violently, and finally the detective intervened: &#34;Easy, easy, the child does not know you.&#34;Defeated, Said let her run away. &#34;I will take her,&#34; he said angrily, sitting bolt upright.</p><h2>The Marrow of Tradition (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)</h2><p>This novel is based on a historically accurate account of the Wilmington, North Carolina, "race riot" of 1898, and is a passionate portrait of the betrayal of black culture in America, by an acclaimed African-American writer.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Chestnutt</b> (1858&#x2013;1932) was born in Cleveland, Ohio, where his family had moved from Fayettefille, North Carolina, to seek better economic opportunities. Shortly after the Civil War, they returned to Fayetteville, where Chesnutt spent most of his childhood and young adulthood. He taught in local public schools, eventually returning to Cleveland and being admitted to the bar. He established a legal stenography business yet found himself strongly attracted to writing fiction. He published two collections of short stories, <i>The Conjure Woman</i> and <i>The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories of the Color Line</i> (1890) and three widely reviewed novels, <i>The House Behind the Cedars</i> (1900), <i>The Marrow of Tradition</i> (1901), and <i>The Colonel's Dream</i> (1905), while devoting essays and speeches to agitation for civil rights for African Americans, especially in the South. Unable to support his family as a full-time writer, he resumed his business career but maintained until his death a respected role in African American letters.<br><br><b>Eric J. Sundquist</b>&nbsp;is the Andrew W. Mellon Professor of the Humanities at the Johns Hopkins University, where he teaches courses about American literature and culture. His books include&nbsp;<i>King&#x2019;s Dream: The Legacy of Martin Luther King&#x2019;s &#x201c;I Have a Dream&#x201d; Speech</i>&nbsp;and<i>&nbsp;Strangers in the Land: Blacks, Jews, Post-Holocaust America</i>. Professor Sundquist has also edited essay collections on Mark Twain, Ralph Ellison, and W. E. B. Du Bois.Chesnutt, one of the most important African-American writers of the nineteenth century, tells a complex tale of race, injustice, and passion. His style is elaborate; Chesnutt sometimes writes in the formal cadences of the Victorian novel and sometimes in a range of heavy Southern dialects. However, Michael Collins masters all dialects and makes characters as disparate as white trash Captain McBain and Jane, the aged black servant, live with equal facility. A few sound effects, such as period music and crowd sounds during the riot at the book's climax, contribute to give the impression that Collins is performing the book rather than simply reading it.

Anything can happen on such a walk: you might pass a cat, or a friend, or even an early raccoon. And as you go down your street and around the corner, the windows around you light up one by one until you are walking through a maze of paper lanterns, each one granting you a brief, glowing snapshot of your neighbors as families come together and folks settle in for the night. With a setting that feels both specific and universal and a story full of homages to <i>The Snowy Day, </i>Julia Denos and E. B.

On the heels of explaining to his planetary leader the intricacies of human genetics in <i>The Stuff of Life</i>, the intrepid alien scientist Bloort-183 is charged in this sequel with covering the wider story of evolution. Using the same storytelling conceit that <i>Plenty </i>magazine declared "so charming that you won't even notice you've absorbed an entire scientific field" and that caused <i>Seed </i>to pick <i>The Stuff of Life </i>as a best book of 2008, <i>Evolution </i>brilliantly answers <i>Wired</i>'s demand, "What's the solution to America's crisis in science education? More comic books!" </p><p><i>Evolution</i>, the most accessible graphic work on this universally studied subject, takes the reader from earth's primordial soup to the vestigial structures, like the coccyx and the male nipple, of modern humans. Once again, the award-winning illustrations of the Cannons render the complex clear and everything cleverly comedic.

Forty years ago the communists came down from the north and they took the place. They renamed it Ho Chi Minh City in honor of their conquering leader. To the victors the spoils. They executed collaborators and imprisoned unreliables and they changed the politics, the culture, and the fabric of the lives of those who lived here.</p><p>It looked a little different now, but to John it felt the same. The cloying evening heat and the smell of exhaust fumes mixing with the pressing jungle, the incense and cigarette smoke and the spiced meat, the buzz of the stifling crowds and the lights from the energetic streets.</p><p>And the sense of pervasive danger, just out of sight but closing, like an invading army.</p><p>They could name this city after his sworn enemy from the past, they could call it whatever the hell they wanted, but to the sixty-six-year-old man sitting in the open-front caf� in District 8, that didn&#x2019;t change a thing.</p><p>This was still <i>fucking</i> Saigon.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Clark sat with his legs crossed, his shirt collar open, and his tan tropic-weight sport coat lying across the chair next to him because the slow-moving palm-frond fan above him did nothing more than churn the hot air. Younger men and women swirled around him, heading either to tables in the back or out onto the busy pavement in front of the caf�, but Clark sat still as stone.</p><p>Except for his eyes; his eyes darted back and forth, scanning the street.</p><p>He was struck by the lack of Americans in uniform, the one big disconnect from his memories of old Saigon. Forty-odd years ago he&#x2019;d trod these streets in olive drab or jungle camo. Even when he was here in country with the CIA&#x2019;s MACV-SOG (Military Assistance Command, Vietnam&#x2014;Studies and Observations Group), he&#x2019;d rarely worn civilian clothing. He was a Navy SEAL, there was a war going on, battle dress was appropriate for an American, even one in country working direct-action ops for the Agency.</p><p>Also missing were the bicycles. Back then ninety percent of the wheeled traffic on this street would have been bikes. Today there were some bikes, sure, but mostly it was scooters and motorcycles and small cars filling the street, with pedestrian throngs covering the sidewalks.</p><p>And nobody wore a uniform around here.</p><p>He took a sip of green tea in the glow of the votive candle flickering on his bistro table. He didn&#x2019;t care for the tea, but this place didn&#x2019;t have beer or even wine. What it <i>did</i> have was line of sight on the Lion d&#x2019;Or, a large French colonial restaurant, just across Huynh Thi Phung Street. He looked away from the passersby, stopped thinking about the days when twenty-five percent of them would have been U.S. military, and he glanced back to the Lion d&#x2019;Or. As hard as it was to divorce himself from the past, he managed to put the war out of his mind, because this evening his task was the man drinking alone at a corner table in the restaurant, just twenty-five yards from where Clark sat.</p><p>The subject of Clark&#x2019;s surveillance was American, a few years younger than Clark, bald and thickly built. To Clark it was clear this man seemed to be having issues this evening. His jaw was fixed in anger, his body movements were jolting and exaggerated like a man nearly overcome with fury.</p><p>Clark could relate. He was in a particularly foul humor himself.</p><p>He watched the subject for another moment, then checked his watch and pressed down on a button on a small wireless controller in his left hand. He spoke aloud, albeit softly, even though no one sat close by. &#x201c;One-hour mark. Whoever he&#x2019;s meeting is making him wait for the honor of their company.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Three stories above and directly behind Clark&#x2014;on the roof of a mixed-use colonial-style office building&#x2014;three men, all lying prone and wearing muted colors and black backpacks, scanned the street below them. They were connected to Clark via their earbuds, and they&#x2019;d picked up his transmission.</p><p>Domingo &#x201c;Ding&#x201d; Chavez, in the middle of the three, centered his Nikon on the man in the restaurant and focused the lens. Then he pressed his own push-to-talk button and answered back softly: &#x201c;Subject is not a happy camper. Looks like he&#x2019;s about to put his fist through the wall.&#x201d;</p><p>Clark replied from below. &#x201c;If I have to sit here in this heat and sip this disgusting tea much longer, I&#x2019;m going to do the same.&#x201d;</p><p>Chavez cleared his throat uncomfortably, then said, &#x201c;Uh, it&#x2019;s not too bad up here. How about one of us take the eye at ground level, you can make your way to the roof?&#x201d;</p><p>The reply came quick. &#x201c;Negative. Hold positions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Roger that.&#x201d;</p><p>Sam Driscoll chuckled. He lay on Chavez&#x2019;s left, just a few feet away, his eye to a spotting scope that he used to scan to the north of the restaurant, watching the road for any sign of trouble. He spoke to the men around him, but he didn&#x2019;t transmit. &#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s grumpy.&#x201d;</p><p>Several yards to Chavez&#x2019;s right, Jack Ryan, Jr., peered through his camera, scanning the pedestrians on the sidewalk to the south of their overwatch. He focused his attention on a leggy blonde climbing out of a cab. While doing so he asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with Clark? He&#x2019;s usually the last one of us to bitch, but he&#x2019;s been like this all day.&#x201d;</p><p>There was no one else on this rooftop other than the three Americans, but Chavez had been doing this sort of thing for most of his adult life. He knew his voice would carry through the metal air-conditioning duct behind him if he wasn&#x2019;t careful, so he answered back as if he were in a library. &#x201c;Mr. C&#x2019;s got some history around here, is all. Probably coming back to him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Ryan said. &#x201c;He must be reliving the war.&#x201d;</p><p>Ding smiled in the darkness. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s part of it. Clark&#x2019;s down in that caf� thinking about the shit he saw. The shit he did. But he&#x2019;s also thinking about running around here as a twenty-five-year-old SEAL stud. It probably scares him how much he wishes he was back in the groove. War or no war.&#x201d;</p><p>Ryan said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s holding up for an old guy. We should all be so lucky.&#x201d;</p><p>Driscoll shifted on his belly to find a more comfortable position on the asphalt mansard roof, though he kept his eye in his optic, centering now on the man at the table. &#x201c;Clark&#x2019;s right. It doesn&#x2019;t look like this meet is going to happen, and watching this guy through a ten-power scope while he drinks his liver into oblivion is getting old.&#x201d;</p><p>While Sam focused on the subject, Ryan continued following the blonde as she pushed through the foot traffic heading north along Huynh Thi Phung Street. He tracked her to the front door of Lion d&#x2019;Or. &#x201c;Good news. I think our evening just got interesting.&#x201d;</p><p>Chavez followed Ryan&#x2019;s gaze. &#x201c;Really? How so?&#x201d;</p><p>Jack watched the woman as she turned sharply into the restaurant from the sidewalk and moved directly toward their subject&#x2019;s table. &#x201c;The meet has arrived, and <i>she</i> is hot.&#x201d;</p><p>Chavez saw her through his own binos now. &#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s better than watching another fat dude slurp gin.&#x201d; He pressed the push-to-talk button again. &#x201c;John, we&#x2019;ve got a&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Clark&#x2019;s voice crackled over Chavez, because he had the command unit on their network and could override other transmissions. &#x201c;I see her. Too bad we don&#x2019;t have any fucking audio.&#x201d;</p><p>The men on the roof all laughed nervously. Damn, Clark <i>was</i> grouchy tonight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1</p><p>Colin Hazelton made a show of checking the time on his mobile phone as the woman sat down. She was an hour late and he wanted to indicate his displeasure, even if only passive-aggressively.</p><p>She fixed the hem of her skirt and crossed her legs, and only then did she look up at him. She seemed to notice the phone and his focus on it, then she lifted the sweating water glass in front of her and took a sip.</p><p>Hazelton dropped his phone back into his pocket and drank down half of his gin and tonic. He had to admit she was every bit as attractive as advertised. It was virtually all his control had said about his contact tonight. Statuesque and blond, with mannerisms that transmitted refinement and poise. Still, Hazelton was too pissed to be impressed. Not pissed at her, exclusively, but generally angry, and he certainly wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to ogle his contact tonight.</p><p>That she&#x2019;d made him wait a goddamned hour took even more of the luster off her splendor.</p><p>Before either spoke the waiter appeared. It was that kind of place, not like the dive bars and tea shops that populated the rest of this part of Huynh Thi Phung Street.</p><p>The woman ordered a glass of white wine in perfect French. Hazelton could tell it was her native tongue, but his control officer had mentioned this fact as well, between breathless comments about her almond eyes and her lithe body.</p><p>He assumed she was a former French spook, either DGSE or DCRI, although she also could have been from DST, which became DCRI in 2008. Virtually everyone Hazelton met with in the course of his work was a former intelligence officer, so this was no stretch.</p><p>She did not introduce herself, though he wasn&#x2019;t surprised by this. He had, however, expected some contrition for her late arrival. But she didn&#x2019;t mention it at all. Instead, she opened with, &#x201c;You brought the documents?&#x201d;</p><p>Hazelton did not answer her directly. &#x201c;What do you know about the circumstances of the operation?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The circumstances?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The client.

Her nails were perfectly manicured, and her skin glowed with lotion. &#x201c;When they don&#x2019;t brief me, I take that to mean I am not supposed to know.&#x201d; She looked Hazelton over. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t appear to be new to this work, so surely you understand this.&#x201d; Her French accent was thick, but her English was flawless.</p><p>He took another gulp of gin. &#x201c;Sometimes it&#x2019;s best to know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps that is your philosophy.

She wanted to move on. &#x201c;So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do you have them or not?&#x201d;</p><p>Hazelton spoke slowly and softly, but stressing every word through a slur from the alcohol he&#x2019;d been consuming all day, both here and in the lobby bar back at his hotel. <i>&#x201c;North&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Instead, she replied, &#x201c;You are very emotional, aren&#x2019;t you? This surprises me. I know you were given a rush assignment, someone took ill and they pulled out and then you were called over, but New York should know better than to send in an emotional traveling officer.&#x201d; Below the table, Hazelton felt the tip of her high-heeled shoe as it ran along his leg, just next to his ankle. There was a time in his life when this would have excited him, but that was long ago. This was work; he knew she was just feeling around to see if he had a briefcase. Soon he heard her toe thump his case, next to his leg.</p><p>She said, &#x201c;Slide it to me, please.&#x201d;</p><p>The big American just sat there. He drummed his fingers on the table.

Would he pass the items or shred them and dump them in a river like fish food? The ramifications for each course of action had been weighing on him all day. But now a sense of composure came over him, and he heard himself say, &#x201c;You know what? I didn&#x2019;t sign on to this job to be an errand boy for a bunch of murdering psychos.&#x201d; Then, &#x201c;There is other work to be had without stooping this low.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; the woman said, and while speaking she glanced into the street, a casual gaze. She looked bored, but Hazelton knew she was simply keeping an eye out for surveillance.</p><p>Hazelton waved his arm in the air angrily. &#x201c;To hell with this. I&#x2019;m out.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman, by contrast, displayed no emotion. <i>&#x201c;Out?&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not passing the documents on to you.&#x201d;</p><p>She sighed a little now. &#x201c;Is this about money? If so, you will need to talk to New York. I have no authorization to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not about money. It&#x2019;s about good and evil. That&#x2019;s completely lost on you, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My job has nothing to do with either.&#x201d;</p><p>Hazelton looked at the woman with complete derision. His decision had been made. &#x201c;Tell yourself that if you need to, but you&#x2019;re <i>not</i> getting these docs.&#x201d; He kicked the briefcase loud enough for her to hear it.</p><p>The woman nodded. A countenance of calm. Her detachment was odd to Hazelton. He&#x2019;d expected screaming and yelling. She just said, &#x201c;This will complicate things. New York will be angry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Screw New York.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope you don&#x2019;t expect me to join you in your moral crusade.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doll, I don&#x2019;t give a damn what you do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you won&#x2019;t give a damn when I walk out of here and make a phone call.&#x201d;</p><p>Hazelton paused, the strain of his work and the travel evident on his face. &#x201c;Call him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He will send someone to take that case from you.&#x201d;</p><p>Hazelton smiled now. &#x201c;He might try. But like you said, I&#x2019;m not exactly new at this. I have a few tricks up my sleeve.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For your sake, I hope you do.&#x201d; The Frenchwoman stood and turned away, passing the smiling waiter approaching the table with the wine on a silver tray.</p></p><h2>Kennedy's Last Stand: Eisenhower, UFOs, MJ-12 &amp; JFK's Assassination</h2><p>Just before beginning his first term on January 20, 1993, President-Elect Clinton made a very strange request to close family friend and lawyer Webster Hubbell: &#x201c;If I put you over there in justice I want you to find the answer to two questions for me: One, who killed JFK. And two, are there UFOs.&#x201d; According to Hubbell, &#x201c;Clinton was dead serious.&#x201d; The key to unlocking the mystery of President Kennedy&#x2019;s assassination and a possible UFO connection lie in events that occurred 18 years earlier in post-war Germany. In 1945 John F. Kennedy was a guest of Navy Secretary James Forrestal, where he personally witnessed technological secrets that have still not been disclosed to the world. These secrets stemmed from extraterrestrial technologies that Nazi Germany had acquired and were attempting to use in their weapons programs. In searching for answers to who killed President Kennedy we need to start with the death of his mentor, James Forrestal in 1949. Forrestal became the first Secretary of Defense in 1947, a position he held until March, 1949. Forrestal was a visionary who thought Americans had a right to know about the existence of extraterrestrial life and technologies. Forrestal was sacked by President Truman because he was revealing the truth to various officials, including Kennedy who was a Congressman at the time. Forrestal's ideals and vision inspired Kennedy, and laid the seed for what would happen 12 years later. After winning the 1960 Presidential election, Kennedy learned a shocking truth from President Eisenhower. The control group set up to run highly classified extraterrestrial technologies, the Majestic-12 Group, had become a rogue government agency. Eisenhower warned Kennedy that MJ-12 had to be reined in. It posed a direct threat to American liberties and democratic processes. Kennedy followed Eisenhower&#x2019;s advice, and set out to realize James Forrestal&#x2019;s vision. The same forces that orchestrated Forrestal's death, opposed Kennedy's efforts at every turn. When Kennedy was on the verge of succeeding, by forcing the CIA to share classified UFO information with other government agencies on November 12, 1963, he was assassinated ten days later. Kennedy&#x2019;s Last Stand is the story of how an American President tried to realize his friend and mentor&#x2019;s vision of a world where humanity openly knows about extraterrestrial life; and of the government officials responsible for denying that vision.</p><p>Just before beginning his first term on January 20, 1993, President-Elect Clinton&nbsp;made a very strange request to close family friend and lawyer Webster Hubbell: "If I put you over there in justice I want you to find the answer to two questions for me: One, who killed JFK.

Drawing on speeches, diaries, letters, and other original documents, Paula Giddings powerfully portrays how black women have transcended racist and sexist attitudes--often confronting white feminists and black male leaders alike--to initiate social and political reform. From the open disregard for the rights of slave women to examples of today's more covert racism and sexism in civil rights and women'sorganizations, Giddings illuminates the black woman's crusade for equality. In the process, she paints unforgettable portraits of black female leaders, such as anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells, educator and FDR adviser Mary McLeod Bethune, and the heroic civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer, among others, who fought both overt and institutionalized oppression. </p><p><em>When and Where I Enter</em> reveals the immense moral power black women possessed and sought to wield throughout their history--the same power that prompted Anna Julia Cooper in 1892 to tell a group of black clergymen, "Only the black woman can say 'when and where I enter, in the quiet, undisputed dignity of my womanhood, without violence and without suing or special patronage, then and there the whole . . . race enters with me.'"</p></p><p><p>Paula J.

This collection includes presentations by several well-known evangelical scholars including Gordon Johnston, Darrell Bock, Richard Averbeck, Klaus Issler, and others.</p><p>Foundations of Spiritual Formation takes a unique approach to its subject, arguing that we become like Christ in the context of authentic, Christian community. Without undermining individual Bible study, private prayer, and meditation, the authors emphasize these pursuits for the purpose of both personal and community enrichment-that the whole body, as well as the individual, may be built up. Part 1 lays the foundations of spiritual formation. Jonathan Morrow develops a distinctively evangelical theology, while Richard Averbeck writes about worship. Then Gordon Johnston and Darrell Bock delve into the text of Scripture, grounding the pursuit of spiritual formation in revealed truth. Part 2 focuses on functional aspects of spiritual formation. Klaus Issler emphasizes the importance of the heart in spiritual formation, while Reid Kisling illustrates the vital connection between character development and spiritual formation. Bill Miller explores love's role as the motivation for spiritual formation. Andrew Seidel examines servant leadership, and George Hillman extends the discussion to include the significance of calling. Gail Seidel discusses personal narrative as a catalyst for spiritual formation, and in closing, Harry Shields advocates the public preaching of the Word as a tool for spiritual formation.

She also varies her pace, speeding up and slowing down to indicate shifts in viewpoint from female to male characters. The different emphases also ensure that listeners can differentiate the wide-ranging cast throughout the span of story, which includes two main characters as well as several who appear only in brief scenes.

His consistently faithful depiction of these humble people's lives is a major strength of the Emigrant Novels.<br><br>Moberg's extensive research in the papers of Swedish emigrants in archival collections, including the Minnesota Historical Society, enabled him to incorporate many details of pioneer life. First published between 1949 and 1959 in Swedish, these four books were considered a single work by Moberg, who intended that they be read as documentary novels.

But the felines really start throwing catfits when they come across a dead body or two...<br><br>A serial killer may be right under Koko's nose, and now this ingenious Siamese must dig deeper to clear poor Qwilleran of suspicion&#x2014;and dig up the motive for a <i>cat</i>astrophic crime.</p><p>The history of <b>Lilian Jackson Braun</b> is perhaps as exciting and mysterious as her novels. Between 1966 and 1968, she published three novels to critical acclaim:&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Turned On and Off</i>.&nbsp; In 1966,&nbsp;the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;labeled Braun, &#x201c;the new detective of the year.&#x201d; Then, for reasons unknown, the rising mystery author disappeared from the publishing scene. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1986 that Berkley Publishing Group reintroduced Braun to the public with the publication of an original paperback,&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Saw Red</i>. Within two years, Berkley released four new novels in paperback and reprinted the three mysteries from the sixties. Since then, G.P. Putnam&#x2019;s Sons has published seventeen additional novels in the Cat Who series. Braun passed away in 2011.While the 10th entry in the "Cat Who" series is enjoyable and has its charms, it is less a mystery than a recital of how veteran reporter and millionaire Jim Qwilleran and his feline companions, Koko and Yum Yum, spent their vacation, and an account of the people they encountered. Moreover, most of the plot development occurs near the end, so the denouement appears contrived. Fiftyish bachelor "Qwill" decides to spend the summer at a lakefront cottage near the resort town of Mooseville. His vision of an idyllic respite is shattered from the moment he arrives. Almost everything in the house needs repair and Qwill could use more space; adding a wing is the logical solution, but he learns that most such jobs are done by itinerant builders. Fortunately, Clem Cottle, a local handyman, accepts the project, but he soon disappears, the third carpenter in recent months to vanish; two others met with fatal freak accidents. When Clem's replacement, Iggy Small, misses work, and his corpse is found in Qwill's basement, our vacationing hero suspects a serial killer and begins to investigate. Of course, the intelligent Koko helps solve the crime. For inveterate Braun ( The Cat Who Sniffed Glue ) fans only.

Regular, heavy, nighttime breathing. One was snoring, and that was Auntie Sara, who had been given a mattress beneath the open window.<br> &nbsp;<br> She closed her eyes and tried to breathe like the others. It was difficult to sleep, especially because everything around her was so new and different. The sounds of the night and the forest beyond the window in �stg�rd were different. The people she knew from the meetings in the citadel and the summer camps were somehow not the same. She was not the same, either. The face and body she saw in the mirror this summer were new. And her emotions, these strange hot and cold currents that flowed through her when the boys looked at her. Or when one of them in particular looked at her. Robert. He was different this year, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> She opened her eyes again and stared. She knew God had the power to do great things, even allow her to see the stars through the roof. If it was His wish.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had been a long and eventful day. The dry summer wind had whispered through the corn, and the leaves on the trees danced as if in a fever, causing the light to filter through to the visitors on the field. They had been listening to one of the Salvation Army cadets from the -officer--training school talking about his work as a preacher on the Faeroe Islands. He was -good--looking and spoke with great sensitivity and passion. But she was preoccupied with shooing away a bumblebee that kept buzzing around her head, and by the time it moved off, the heat had made her drowsy. When the cadet finished, all faces were turned to the territorial commander, David Eckhoff, who had been observing them with his smiling, young eyes, which were actually over fifty years old. He saluted in the Salvation Army manner, with his right hand raised above his shoulder and pointing to the kingdom of heaven, amid a resounding shout of &#x201c;Hallelujah!&#x201d; Then he prayed for the cadets&#x2019; work with the poor and the pariahs to be blessed, and reminded them of the Gospel of Matthew, where it said that Jesus the Redeemer was among them, a stranger on the street, maybe a criminal, without food and without clothing. And that on Judgment Day the righteous, those who had helped the weakest, would have eternal life. It had all the makings of a long speech, but then someone whispered something and he said, with a smile, that Youth Hour was next on the program and today it was Rikard Nilsen&#x2019;s turn.<br> &nbsp;<br> She had heard Rikard make his voice deeper than it was to thank the commander. As usual, he had prepared what he was going to say in writing and memorized it. He stood up and recited how he was going to devote his life to the fight, to Jesus&#x2019;s fight for the kingdom of God. His voice was nervous, yet monotonous and soporific. His introverted glower rested on her. Her eyes were heavy. His sweaty top lip was moving to form the familiar, secure, tedious phrases. So she -didn&#x2019;t react when the hand touched her back. Not until it became fingertips and they wandered down to the small of her back, and lower, and made her freeze beneath her thin summer dress.<br> &nbsp;<br> She turned and looked into Robert&#x2019;s smiling brown eyes. And she wished her skin were as dark as his so that he would not be able to see her blush.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Shh,&#x201d; Jon had said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Robert and Jon were brothers. Although Jon was one year older, many people had taken them for twins when they were younger. But Robert was seventeen now and while they had retained some facial similarities, the differences were clearer. Robert was happy and carefree, liked to tease and was good at playing the guitar, but was not always punctual for services in the citadel, and sometimes the teasing had a tendency to go too far, especially if he noticed others were laughing. Then Jon would often step in. Jon was an honest, conscientious boy who most thought would go to -officer--training school and -would&#x2014;-though this was never formulated out -loud&#x2014;-find himself a girl in the Army. The latter could not be taken for granted in Robert&#x2019;s case. Jon was three-quarters of an inch taller than Robert, but in some strange way Robert seemed taller. From the age of twelve Jon had begun to stoop, as though he were carrying the woes of the world on his back. Both were -dark--skinned, -good--looking, with regular features, but Robert had something Jon did not have. There was something in his eyes, something black and playful, which she wanted and yet did not want to investigate further.<br> &nbsp;<br> While Rikard was talking, her eyes were wandering across the sea of assembled familiar faces. One day she would marry a boy from the Salvation Army and perhaps they would both be posted to another town or another part of the country. But they would always return to �stg�rd, which the Army had just bought and was to be their summer site from now on.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the margins of the crowd, sitting on the steps leading to the house, was a boy with blond hair stroking a cat that had settled in his lap. She could tell that he had been watching her, but he had looked away just as she noticed. He was the one person here she -didn&#x2019;t know, but she did know that his name was Mads Gilstrup, that he was the grandchild of the people who had owned �stg�rd before, that he was a couple of years older than her and that the Gilstrup family was wealthy. He was attractive, in fact, but there was something solitary about him. And what was he doing here, anyway? He had been there the previous night, walking around with an angry frown on his face, not talking to anyone. She had felt his eyes on her a few times. Everyone looked at her this year. That was new, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was jerked out of these thoughts by Robert taking her hand, putting something in it and saying: &#x201c;Come to the barn when the -general--in--waiting has finished. I&#x2019;ve got something to show you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Then he stood up and walked off, and she looked down into her hand and almost screamed. With one hand over her mouth, she dropped the object into the grass. It was a bumblebee. It could still move, despite not having legs or wings.<br> &nbsp;<br> At last Rikard finished, and she sat watching her parents and Robert and Jon&#x2019;s parents moving -toward the tables where the coffee was. They were both what Army people in their respective Oslo congregations called &#x201c;strong families,&#x201d; and she knew watchful eyes were on her.<br> &nbsp;<br> She walked -toward the outhouse. Once she was around the corner, where no one could see her, she scurried in the direction of the barn.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you know what this is?&#x201d; said Robert with the smile in his eyes and the deep voice he had not had the summer before.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was lying on his back in the hay whittling a tree root with the penknife he always carried in his belt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then he held it up and she saw what it was. She had seen drawings. She hoped it was too dark for him to see her blush again.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she lied, sitting beside him in the hay.<br> &nbsp;<br> And he gave her that teasing look of his, as if he knew something about her she -didn&#x2019;t even know herself. She returned his gaze and fell back on her elbows.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is where it goes,&#x201d; he said, and in an instant his hand was up her dress. She could feel the hard tree root against the inside of her thigh and, before she could close her legs, it was touching her underpants. His breath was hot on her neck.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, Robert,&#x201d; she whispered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But I made it for you,&#x201d; he wheezed in return.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Stop. I don&#x2019;t want to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you saying no? To me?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She caught her breath and was unable either to answer or to scream because at that moment they heard Jon&#x2019;s voice from the barn door: &#x201c;Robert! No, Robert!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She felt him relax and let go, and the tree root was left between her clenched thighs as he withdrew his hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come here!&#x201d; Jon said, as though talking to a disobedient dog.<br> &nbsp;<br> With a chuckle Robert got up, winked at her and ran out into the sun to his brother.<br> &nbsp;<br> She sat up and brushed the hay off her, feeling both relieved and ashamed at the same time. Relieved because Jon had spoiled their crazy game. Ashamed because he seemed to think it was more than that: a game.<br> &nbsp;<br> Later, during grace before their evening meal, she had looked up straight into Robert&#x2019;s brown eyes and seen his lips form one word. She -didn&#x2019;t know what it was, but she had started to giggle. He was crazy! And she was . . . well, what was she? Crazy, too. Crazy. And in love? Yes, in love, precisely that. And not in the way she had been when she was twelve or thirteen. Now she was fourteen and this was bigger. More important. And more exciting.<br> &nbsp;<br> She could feel the laughter bubbling up inside her now, as she lay there trying to stare through the roof.<br> &nbsp;<br> Auntie Sara grunted and stopped snoring beneath the window. Something screeched. An owl?<br> &nbsp;<br> She needed to pee.<br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t feel like going out, but she had to. Had to walk through the dewy grass past the barn, which was dark and quite a different proposition in the middle of the night. She closed her eyes, but it didn&#x2019;t help. She crept out of her sleeping bag, slipped on some sandals and tiptoed over to the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> A few stars had appeared in the sky, but they would disappear when day broke in the east in an -hour&#x2019;s time. The cool air caressed her skin as she scampered along, listening to the unidentifiable sounds of the night. Insects that stayed quiet during the day. Animals hunting. Rikard said he had seen foxes in the distant copse. Or perhaps the animals were the same ones that were out during the day, but just made different sounds. They changed. Shed their skins, so to speak.<br> &nbsp;<br> The outhouse stood alone on a small mound behind the barn. She watched it grow in size as she came closer. The strange, crooked hut had been made with untreated wooden boards that had warped, split and turned gray. No windows, a heart on the door. The worst thing about it was that you never knew if anyone was already in there.<br> &nbsp;<br> And she had an instinct that someone was already in there.<br> &nbsp;<br> She coughed so that whoever was there might signal his presence. A magpie took off from a branch on the edge of the wood. Otherwise all was still.<br> &nbsp;<br> She stepped up onto the flagstone. Grabbed the lump of wood that passed for a door handle. Pulled it. The black room gaped open.<br> &nbsp;<br> She breathed out. There was a flashlight beside the toilet seat, but she -didn&#x2019;t need to switch it on. She raised the seat lid before closing the door and fastening the door hook. Then she pulled up her nightgown, pulled down her underwear and sat down. In the ensuing silence she thought she heard something. Something that was neither animal nor magpie nor insects shedding skin. Something that moved fast through the tall grass behind the toilet. Then the trickle started and the noise was obscured. But her heart had already started pounding.<br> &nbsp;<br> When she had finished, she quickly pulled up her underpants and sat in the dark listening. But all she could hear was a faint ripple in the tops of the trees and her blood throbbing in her ears. She waited for her pulse to slow down, then she unhooked the catch and opened the door. The dark figure filled almost the entire doorway. He must have been standing and waiting silently outside on the stone step. The next minute she was splayed over the toilet seat and he stood above her. He closed the door behind him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You?&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me,&#x201d; he said in an alien, tremulous, husky voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then he was on top of her. His eyes glittered in the dark as he bit her lower lip until he drew blood and one hand found the way under her nightgown and tore off her underwear. She lay there crippled with fear beneath the knife blade that stung the skin on her neck while he kept thrusting his groin into her before he had even got his trousers off, like some crazed, copulating dog.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One word from you and I&#x2019;ll cut you into pieces,&#x201d; he whispered. And not one word issued from her mouth. Because she was fourteen years old and sure that if she shut her eyes tightly and concentrated she would be able to see the stars through the roof. God had the power to do things like that. If it was His wish.</p><h2>MATLAB: A Practical Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving</h2><p><p><i>MATLAB: A Practical Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving, Fifth Edition, </i>winner of a 2017 Textbook Excellence Award (<i>Texty</i>), guides the reader through both programming and built-in functions to easily exploit MATLAB's extensive capabilities for tackling engineering problems.

If the precious yellow metal hadn't been discovered ... the development of San Francisco's underworld in all likelihood would have been indistinguishable from that of any other large American city. Instead, owing almost entirely to the influx of gold-seekers and the horde of gamblers, thieves, harlots, politicians, and other felonious parasites who battened upon them, there arose a unique criminal district that for almost seventy years was the scene of more viciousness and depravity, but which at the same time possessed more glamour, than any other area of vice and iniquity on the American continent. The Barbary Coast is Herbert Asbury's classic chronicle of the birth of San Francisco&#x2014;a violent explosion from which the infant city emerged full-grown and raging wild. From all over the world practitioners of every vice stampeded for the blood and money of the gold fields. Gambling dens ran all day including Sundays. From noon to noon houses of prostitution offered girls of every age and race. (In the 1850s, San Francisco was home to only one woman for every thirty men. It was not until 1910 that the sexes achieved anything close to parity in their populations.) This is the story of the banditry, opium bouts, tong wars, and corruption, from the eureka at Sutter's Mill until the last bagnio closed its doors seventy years later.</p><p><b>Herbert Asbury</b> (1891&#x2013;1963) was a prolific journalist and editor.

At a time when secular humanism was increasingly asserting man&#39;s complete autonomy, Cabasilas proclaimed that man&#39;s true life lies not in himself, but in Christ. For him, man&#39;s redemption in Jesus Christ is not just a matter of history, which can be elucidated simply by scholarly endeavor. It is a saving event in which man is called to participate here and now, in body and spirit as well as intellect, through the sacramental life of the Church. The present translation makes this devotional classic available for the first time in English, while the extensive introduction by Boris Bobrinskoy assesses its place within the history of eastern spirituality.</p><p><p>Nicholas Cabasilas was a 14th Century Byzantine mystic and theological writer. Born in Thessaloniki, he is primarily remembered for his two classic treatises, The Life in Christ and A Commentary on the Divine Liturgy, both of which are published by SVS Press.</p>Text: English, Greek (translation)</p><h2>The Octopus: Secret Government and the Death of Danny Casolaro</h2><p>The primary conspiracy of the late 20th century.</p><p></p><h2>A life Worth Living</h2><p>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

The back- to- back consults gave her nearly as much of aboost as the strong, sweet coffee. Basking in it, she leaned backin the chair in her cozy office to read over the side notes she&#x2019;dadded to each client.</p><p>In her experience, the personality of the couple&#x2014; or often,more accurately, the bride&#x2014; helped her determine the tone ofthe consult, the direction they&#x2019;d pursue. To Emma&#x2019;s way ofthinking, flowers were the heart of a wedding. Whether theywere elegant or fun, elaborate or simple, the flowers were theromance.</p><p>It was her job to give the client all the heart and romancethey desired.</p><p>She sighed, stretched, then smiled at the vase of petite roseson her desk. Spring, she thought, was the best. The weddingseason kicked into high gear&#x2014; which meant busy days and longnights designing, arranging, creating not only for this spring&#x2019;sweddings, but also next.</p><p>She loved the continuity as much as the work itself.</p><p>That&#x2019;s what Vows had given her and her three best friends.Continuity, rewarding work, and that sense of personal accomplishment.And she got to play with flowers, live with flowers,practically swim in flowers every day.</p><p>Thoughtfully, she examined her hands, and the little nicksand tiny cuts. Some days she thought of them as battle scars andothers as medals of honor. This morning she just wished she&#x2019;dremembered to fit in a manicure.</p><p>She glanced at the time, calculated. Boosted again, she sprangup. Detouring into her bedroom, she grabbed a scarlet hoodie tozip over her pjs. There was time to walk to the main house beforeshe dressed and prepared for the day. At the main houseMrs. Grady would have breakfast, so Emma wouldn&#x2019;t have toforage or cook for herself.</p><p>Her life, she thought as she jogged downstairs, brimmed withlovely perks.</p><p>She passed through the living room she used as a receptionand consult area, and took a quick scan around as she headed forthe door. She&#x2019;d freshen up the flowers on display before the firstmeeting, but oh, hadn&#x2019;t those stargazer lilies opened beautifully?</p><p>She stepped out of what had been a guest house on the BrownEstate and was now her home, and the base for Centerpiece&#x2014; herpart of Vows.</p><p>She took a deep breath of spring air. And shivered.</p><p>Damn it, why couldn&#x2019;t it be warmer? It was April, for God&#x2019;ssake. It was daffodil time. Look how cheerful the pansies she&#x2019;dpotted up looked. She refused to let a chilly morning&#x2014; andokay, it was starting to drizzle on top of it&#x2014; spoil her mood.</p><p>She hunched inside the hoodie, stuck the hand not holdingher coffee mug in her pocket, and began to walk to the mainhouse.</p><p>Things were coming back to life all around her, she remindedherself. If you looked closely enough you could see thepromise of green on the trees, the hint of what would be delicateblooms of dogwood and cherry blossoms. Those daffodilswanted to pop, and the crocuses already had. Maybe there&#x2019;d beanother spring snow, but the worst was over.</p><p>Soon it would be time to dig in the dirt, to bring some of herbeauties out of the green house and put them on display. She addedthe bouquets, the swags and garlands, but nothing beat MotherNature for providing the most poignant landscape for a wedding.</p><p>And nothing, in her opinion, beat the Brown Estate for showingit off.</p><p>The gardens, showpieces even now, would soon explode withcolor, bloom, scent, inviting people to stroll along the curvingpaths, or sit on a bench, relax in sun or shade. Parker put her incharge&#x2014; as much as Parker could put anyone else in charge&#x2014; ofoverseeing them, so every year she got to play, planting somethingnew, or supervising the landscape team.</p><p>The terraces and patios created lovely outdoor living spaces,perfect for weddings and events. Poolside receptions, terracereceptions, ceremonies under the rose arbor or the pergola, orperhaps down by the pond under a willow.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve got it all, she thought.</p><p>The house itself? Could anything be more graceful, morebeautiful? The wonderful soft blue, those warm touches of yellowand cream. All the varied rooflines, the arching windows,the lacy balconies added up to elegant charm. And really, theentrance portico was made for crowding with lush greenery orelaborate colors and textures.</p><p>As a child she&#x2019;d thought of it as a fairyland, complete withcastle.</p><p>Now it was home.</p><p>She veered toward the pool house, where her partner Maclived and kept her photography studio. Even as she aimed for it,the door opened. Emma beamed a smile, shot out a wave to thelanky man with shaggy hair and a tweed jacket who came out.</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2019;Morning, Carter!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Emma.&#x201d;</p><p>Carter&#x2019;s family and hers had been friends almost as long asshe could remember. Now, Carter Maguire, former Yale profand current professor of En glish lit at their high school almamater, was engaged to one of her best friends in the world.</p><p>Life wasn&#x2019;t just good, Emma thought. It was a freaking bedof roses.</p><p>Riding on that, she all but danced to Carter, tugged himdown by his lapel as she angled up on her toes and kissed himnoisily.</p><p>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; he said, and blushed a little.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d; Mackensie, her eyes sleepy, her cap of red hair brightin the gloom, leaned on the doorjamb. &#x201c;Are you trying to maketime with my guy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If only. I&#x2019;d steal him away but you&#x2019;ve dazzled and vampedhim.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damn right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well.&#x201d; Carter offered them both a flustered smile. &#x201c;This is areally nice start to my day. The staffmeeting I&#x2019;m headed to won&#x2019;tbe half as enjoyable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Call in sick.&#x201d; Mac all but purred it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you somethingenjoyable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hah. Well. Anyway. Bye.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma grinned at his back as he hurried off to his car. &#x201c;God,he is so cute.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He really is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And look at you, Happy Girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Happy Engaged Girl. Want to see my ring again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oooh,&#x201d; Emma said obligingly when Mac wiggled her fingers.</p><p>&#x201c;Ahhh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you going for breakfast?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the plan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait.&#x201d; Mac leaned in, grabbed a jacket, then pulled the doorclosed behind her. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have anything but coffee yet, so . . .&#x201d;As they fell into step together, Mac frowned. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my mug.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you want it back now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know why I&#x2019;m cheerful this crappy morning, and it&#x2019;s thesame reason I haven&#x2019;t had time for breakfast. It&#x2019;s called Let&#x2019;sShare the Shower.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Happy Girl is also Bragging Bitch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And proud of it. Why are you so cheerful? Got a man inyour house?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sadly no. But I have five consults booked today. Which is agreat start to the week, and comes on the tail of the lovely endto last week with yesterday&#x2019;s tea party wedding. It was reallysweet, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Our sexagenarian couple exchanging vows and celebratingsurrounded by his kids, her kids, grandchildren. Not just sweet,but also reassuring. Second time around for both of them, andthere they are, ready to do it again, willing to share and blend. Igot some really great shots. Anyway, I think those crazy kids aregoing to make it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Speaking of crazy kids, we really have to talk about yourflowers. December may be far away&#x2014; she says shivering&#x2014; but itcomes fast, as you well know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t even decided on the look for the engagement shotsyet. Or looked at dresses, or thought about colors.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I look good in jewel tones,&#x201d; Emma said and fluttered herlashes.</p><p>&#x201c;You look good in burlap. Talk about bragging bitches.&#x201d;Mac opened the door to the mudroom, and since Mrs. Grady wasback from her winter vacation, remembered to wipe her feet. &#x201c;Assoon as I find the dress, we&#x2019;ll brainstorm the rest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the first one of us to get married. To have your weddinghere.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. It&#x2019;s going to be interesting to see how we manage torun the wedding and be in the wedding.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know you can count on Parker to figure out the logistics.If anyone can make it run smooth, it&#x2019;s Parker.&#x201d;</p><p>They walked into the kitchen, and chaos.</p><p>While the equitable Maureen Grady worked at the stove,movements efficient, face placid, Parker and Laurel faced off acrossthe room.</p><p>&#x201c;It has to be done,&#x201d; Parker insisted.</p><p>&#x201c;Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Laurel, this is business. In business you serve the client.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me tell you what I&#x2019;d like to serve the client.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just stop.&#x201d; Parker, her rich brown hair sleeked back in atail, was already dressed in a meet- the- client suit of midnightblue. Eyes of nearly the same color flashed hot with impatience.</p><p>&#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;ve already put together a list of her choices, the numberof guests, her colors, her floral selections. You don&#x2019;t evenhave to speak to her. I&#x2019;ll liaise.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now let me tell you what you can do with your list.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The bride&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The bride is an asshole. The bride is an idiot, a whiny babybitch who made it very clear nearly one year ago that she neitherneeded nor wanted my par tic u lar ser vices. The bride can biteme because she&#x2019;s not biting any of my cake now that she&#x2019;s realizedher own stupidity.&#x201d;</p><p>In the cotton pajama pants and tank she&#x2019;d slept in, her hairstill in sleep tufts, Laurel dropped onto a chair in the breakfastnook.</p><p>&#x201c;You need to calm down.&#x201d; Parker bent down to pick up afile. Probably tossed on the floor by Laurel, Emma mused.</p><p>&#x201c;Everything you need is in here.&#x201d; Parker laid the file on the table.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already assured the bride we&#x2019;ll accommodate her, so&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you design and bake a four- layer wedding cake betweennow and Saturday, and a groom&#x2019;s cake, and a selection of desserts.To serve two hundred people. You do that with no previouspreparation, and when you&#x2019;ve got three other events overthe weekend, and an evening event in three days.&#x201d;</p><p>Her face set in mutinous lines, Laurel picked up the file anddeliberately dropped it on the floor.</p><p>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re acting like a child.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine. I&#x2019;m a child.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Girls, your little friends have come to play.&#x201d; Mrs. Grady sangit out, her tone overly sweet, her eyes laughing.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, I hear my mom calling me,&#x201d; Emma said and started toease out of the room.</p><p>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; Laurel jumped up. &#x201c;Just listen to this! TheFolk- Harrigan wedding. Saturday, eve ning event. You&#x2019;ll remember,I&#x2019;m sure, how the bride sniffed at the very idea of Icings atVows providing the cake or any of the desserts. How she sneeredat me and my suggestions and insisted her cousin, a pastry chef inNew York, who studied in Paris and designed cakes for importantaffairs would be handling all the desserts.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you remember what she said to me?&#x201d;&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Emma shifted because Laurel&#x2019;s finger pointed at herheart. &#x201c;Not in the exact words.&#x201d;&#x201c;Well, I do. She said she was sure&#x2014; and said it with thatsneer&#x2014; she was sure I could handle most affairs well enough, butshe wanted the best for her wedding. She said that to my face.&#x201d;&#x201c;Which was rude, no question,&#x201d; Parker began.&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not finished,&#x201d; Laurel said between her teeth. &#x201c;Now, atthe eleventh hour, it seems her brilliant cousin has run off withone of her&#x2014; the cousin&#x2019;s&#x2014; clients. Scandal, scandal, as said clientmet brilliant cousin when he commissioned her to design a cakefor his engagement party. Now they&#x2019;re MIA and the bride wantsme to step in and save her day.&#x201d;&#x201c;Which is what we do here. Laurel&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not asking you.&#x201d; She flicked her fingers at Parker,zeroed in on Mac and Emma. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m asking them.&#x201d;&#x201c;What?

She grabbed it like a lifeline, andactually wept in gratitude.&#x201d;</p><p>A new light beamed in Laurel&#x2019;s bluebell eyes. &#x201c;She cried?&#x201d;Parker inclined her head, and cocked an eyebrow at Laurel.</p><p>&#x201c;So?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;While the crying part warms me inside, she&#x2019;ll still have totake what I give her, and like it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You just let me know what you decide on when you decideon it,&#x201d; Emma told her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll work in the flowers and decor forthe table.&#x201d; She sent a sympathetic smile at Parker. &#x201c;What timedid she call you with all this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Three twenty a.m.&#x201d;</p><p>Laurel reached over, gave Parker&#x2019;s hand a pat. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s my part of the deal.

Janet first saw &#34;the spirit people&#34; at age five, but after her mother labeled Janet a demon child, she learned to suppress what would later reveal itself as a rare gift. Follow Janet as she evolves from a scared and powerless child to a rebellious teenager, and later to a confused and doubting Roman Catholic nun. No longer willing to deny her God-given gifts, she leaves the convent to become an unconventional spiritual seeker who is later identified as one of the top psychic-mediums in the country. Janet&#39;s story is as much about her amazing evidential mediumship as it is about her ongoing struggle to find peace and to discover her own personal power. Dramatic evidence from the other side combines with real-life drama as Janet faces obstructionism and intolerance unheard of in this country in recent years. Aided by a real-life angel, Janet holds onto her dream and turns Through the Darkness into a triumph of the human spirit.</p><p></p><h2>The Journal of Eug�ne Delacroix (Arts and Letters)</h2><p>The journal of the French 19th-century Romantic painter Eugene Delacroix is one of art history&#39;s most important documents</p><p>Delacroix&#39;s Journal is one of the great documents in art history, a magnificent work of literature as well as vital documentary source for scholars and students.

Through the dramatic characterization of the famous physicist, Brecht examines the issues of scientific morality and the difficult relationship between the intellectual and authority. This version of the play is the famous one that was brought to completion by Brecht himself, working with Charles Laughton, who played Galileo in the first two American productions (Hollywood and New York, 1947). Since then the play has become a classic in the world repertoire. &#34;The play which most strongly stamped on my mind a sense of Brecht&#39;s great stature as an artist of the modern theatre was Galileo.&#34; - Harold Clurman; &#34;Thoughtful and profoundly sensitive.&#34; - Newsweek.</p><p>Text: English<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Taming of the Shrew (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)</h2><p>A rough-and-tumble farce centered around a lively battle of the sexes, <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> brims with action and bawdy humor. The unconventional romance between a lusty fortune-hunter and a bitter shrew unfolds to the accompaniment of witty, fast-paced dialogue and physical humor in this excellent introduction to Shakespearean comedy.<br>The freebooter Petruchio arrives in Padua to hear of Katharina, a beautiful heiress whose waspish rants and caustic personality have repelled all attempts at courtship. Professing to admire a woman of spirit, Petruchio immediately sets about his wooing.

After a madcap wedding ceremony, the still-protesting Kate is whisked away to be "killed with kindness" and reborn as a loving wife.<br>One of the Bard's earliest and most popular plays, <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> is rife with subplots involving his customary devices of disguise and mistaken identity. The vivid language, studded with elaborate puns, is an engaging complement to the play's slapstick humor. Reprinted complete and unabridged in this inexpensive edition, <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> will delight any reader with its wonderful wordplay and rollicking good spirits.</p><p>This is a new edition of an anonymous play which appears to be an alternative version of Shakespeare&#39;s popular comedy, The Taming of the Shrew. Stephen Miller suggests that someone rewrote Shakespeare&#39;s more complicated version, making it shorter, simpler and different in some ways. The main difference between the two plays concerns the framing story of Christopher Sly, the drunk, who disappears early on in Shakespeare&#39;s version, but who has a much larger role in A Shrew.This edition provides a modernised text and extensive commentary.Webster&#x2019;s paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings in English courses. By using a running English-to-Spanish thesaurus at the bottom of each page, this edition of The Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare was edited for three audiences. The first includes Spanish-speaking students enrolled in an English Language Program (ELP), an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) program, an English as a Second Language Program (ESL), or in a TOEFL� or TOEIC� preparation program. The second audience includes English-speaking students enrolled in bilingual education programs or Spanish speakers enrolled in English speaking schools. The third audience consists of students who are actively building their vocabularies in Spanish in order to take foreign service, translation certification, Advanced Placement� (AP�) or similar examinations. By using the Webster's Spanish Thesaurus Edition when assigned for an English course, the reader can enrich their vocabulary in anticipation of an examination in Spanish or English.

In today&#x2019;s world, the ability to respond creatively to new challenges is demanded of everybody, from corporate CEOs to &#x201c;soccer moms.&#x201d; Those whose toolbox for dealing with life includes only what they have learned in the past from their parents and their teachers are at a distinct disadvantage both in their relationships and in their careers.

Team leader Gillamon tells them, "Each of us will be witness to a unique point in history because of a unique generation of world leaders. Most of them are just children now, or have not yet even been born. Take note of how important one generation of children can be. Marvel at each child and the power they have to change the history of the world for the good of all."<br><br> Liz, Max, Nigel and Clarie sail for the colony of Virginia to deliver a letter that will impact Liz's assigned human: Patrick Henry. Liz must help young Patrick find his<br> true purpose in life--to become the Voice of the Revolution. She begins her quest when he is a seven year-old boy who cares more about fishing and exploring the<br> forest in Virginia than about school. Her task will take time, as Patrick Henry will fail at everything he tries. Liz eventually leads Patrick to take up law, and finally accomplishes her mission when he finds his powerful voice in a courtroom. Little does Patrick Henry or the colony of Virginia know that his voice will set the ball of the American Revolution in motion. Henry will be the only one bold enough to first speak out against the tyrannical King of England, calling for the colonies to rise up and fight for independence. "Liberty or death!" becomes the battle cry to unite thirteen solitary colonies as one nation under God to fight the mighty British lion.<br><br> Meanwhile, Max must see to the protection of young George Washington, who inadvertently starts the French and Indian War. The enemy will mount continual&nbsp;assaults on Washington, from enemy snipers to treasonous members of his military staff. If he is lost, all is lost. Nigel goes on a high-flying kite assignment with Benjamin Franklin to ensure the success of an experiment that will impact the outcome of the war in ways no one could imagine. Al remains in London to live in the royal palace, gathering intelligence right under the nose of King George III. The simple-minded cat will be responsible for delivering some Common Sense to America. Kate is assigned to the richest orphan in France, the young Marquis de Lafayette, who is crucial to the entire quest for Independence.

If Max can't protect George Washington, the patriots will lose the Sword of the Revolution to lead them. Nigel must ensure that Benjamin Franklin's efforts succeed, and Al must gather intelligence right under the nose of the King of England. Victory will be impossible without the powerful ally of France to join in the fight led by its patriotic son, the Marquis de Lafayette. But will Kate be able to protect the young Marquis in time? The fight for liberty will be costly, with an enemy determined to give the patriots and anyone who helps them the other course--death.Award-winning author and speaker Jenny L.

He said that his family always had a party, but I then thought of a bright idea, a public celebration lecture where he would sit in the front row and hear people from his past say laudatory things about his contributions. I blurted out, 'What about a lecture on your hundredth birthday?' Without hesitation, he agreed, and that was the start of a grand event. </p><p>"Well over two hundred fifty people attended his lecture, about a third who knew him from his mathematical writings, another third acquainted with his work in history and politics, and, according to one wag, the rest wanting to see a hundred-year-old man stand up for an hour.

Philip Jenkins has chronicled how the next Christendom has shifted away from the Western church toward the global South and East. Likewise, changing demographics mean that North American society will accelerate its diversity in terms of race, ethnicity and culture. But evangelicalism has long been held captive by its predominantly white cultural identity and history. In this book professor and pastor Soong-Chan Rah calls the North American church to escape its captivity to Western cultural trappings and to embrace a new evangelicalism that is diverse and multiethnic. Rah brings keen analysis to the limitations of American Christianity and shows how captivity to Western individualism and materialism has played itself out in megachurches and emergent churches alike. Many white churches are in crisis and ill-equipped to minister to new cultural realities, but immigrant, ethnic and multiethnic churches are succeeding and flourishing. This prophetic report casts a vision for a dynamic evangelicalism that fully embodies the cultural realities of the twenty-first century. Spiritual renewal is happening within the North American church, from corners and margins not always noticed by those in the center. Come, discover the vitality of the next evangelicalism.</p><p><strong>Soong-Chan Rah</strong> (D.Min., Gordon-Conwell) is the Milton B. Engebretson Assistant Professor of Church Growth and Evangelism at North Park Theological Seminary in Chicago, Illinois. He was the founding senior pastor of Cambridge Community Fellowship Church in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He also serves on the boards of Sojourners and the Catalyst Leadership Center. He is a frequent conference speaker and contributed to <em>Growing Healthy Asian American Churches</em> (InterVarsity Press).&#34;The Next Evangelicalism reminds me of July 4: there&#39;s plenty to celebrate and there are fireworks going off in all directions! But I kept asking myself: What will this next evangelicalism celebration do to us? Will we stay the same or will we follow the leading of God&#39;s Spirit into the next era of evangelicalism, one that will surely be unlike what we have now?

Evans, bestselling historian of Nazi Germany, returns with a monumental new addition to the acclaimed Penguin History of Europe series, covering the period from the fall of Napoleon to the outbreak of World War I. Evans&#x2019;s gripping narrative ranges across a century of social and national conflicts, from the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 to the unification of both Germany and Italy, from the Russo-Turkish wars to the Balkan upheavals that brought this era of relative peace and growing prosperity to an end. Among the great themes it discusses are the decline of religious belief and the rise of secular science and medicine, the journey of art, music, and literature from Romanticism to Modernism, the replacement of old-regime punishments by the modern prison, the end of aristocratic domination and the emergence of industrial society, and the dramatic struggle of feminists for women&#x2019;s equality and emancipation. Uniting the era&#x2019;s broad-ranging transformations was the pursuit of power in all segments of life, from the banker striving for economic power to the serf seeking to escape the power of his landlord, from the engineer asserting society&#x2019;s power over the environment to the psychiatrist attempting to exert science&#x2019;s power over human nature itself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first single-volume history of the century, this comprehensive and sweeping account gives the reader a magnificently human picture of Europe in the age when it dominated the rest of the globe.</p><p><b>Richard J.

There they find a colony of businessmen, college professors, housewives and the like, under the leadership of Kelno, a man claiming to have founded "a brand-new world, a place free from crime, war, bloodshed, and greed"but who is actually a demented megalomaniac. After many breathless encounters with fire walking, human sacrifices to a giant snake, earthquakes and vicious African tiger flies, the Coopers rescue the missionary. Stereotyped characters include the brave, born-again American Christians versus the Satanic Kelso and his deluded followers. Implausible plot, improbable setting, undisciplined writing, but the headlong pace will keep readers turning pages.

And so he began to carve &#x2013; tombstones, birdbaths, and stylized human figures, whose spirits seemed to emerge fully formed from the stone. Soon Edmondson's talents caught the eye of prominent members of the art world, and in 1937 he became the first black artist to have a solo exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. </p><p>Here, in twenty-three free-verse poems, award-winning poet Elizabeth Spires gives voice to Edmondson and his creations, which tell their individual stories with wit and passion. With stunning photographs, including ten archival masterpieces by Louise Dahl-Wolfe and Edward Weston, this is a compelling portrait of a truly original American artist.</p></p><p><p>ELIZABETH SPIRES, the recipient of a Whiting Writers' Award, is the author of six poetry collections for adults, and the children's book <i>The Mouse of Amherst</i>. She lives in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>Starred Review. Grade 7 Up&#x2014;In 23 poems, Spires pays homage to a little-known folk sculptor, William Edmondson. Born on a former plantation outside Nashville in 1874, he was well into his 50s and had spent nearly a lifetime in a variety of jobs ranging from racehorse swipe to janitor when he heard God speaking to him. In the vision, God told him to pick up his tools and carve leftover bits of stone into a tombstone. This divine directive would lead Edmondson to create not only tombstones, but also sculptures and become the first black artist to have a solo show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Each of Spires's poems is accompanied by a full-page, black-and-white photograph, either of Edmondson or of one of his works. Poems paired with photographs of the sculptor weave in some of the artist's own words to flesh out his biography. In poems paired with images of his works, the verse gives voice to the piece itself. The "Three Crows," for example, proclaim "'cause Will made us /cooler than cool, three crows/looking over your shoulder.'" Though this personification feels forced or simplistic in a poem or two, in others the simplicity matches the unassuming nature of the subject itself. All in all, Spires has presented readers with a delightful glimpse into the life and work of a relative unknown.

He lives with his wife and children in Hertfordshire, England.ONE<br><br>The air swirled with marble dust that glittered as it caught the evening sun. Ogedai's heart was full as he guided his horse down the main thoroughfare, taking in every sight and sound around him. There was a sense of urgency in the cacophony of hammer blows and shouted orders. The Mongol tumans had gathered outside the city. His generals, his people, had been summoned there to see what two years of labor had created: a city in a wilderness, with the Orkhon River tamed and bent to his will.<br><br>Ogedai reined in for a moment to watch a group of workmen unload a cart. Nervous under his gaze, the laborers used ropes, pulleys, and sheer numbers to maneuver blocks of white marble onto low sledges that could be dragged into the workshops. Each milky block was subtly veined in a light blue that pleased Ogedai. He owned the quarry that had birthed the stones, hundreds of miles to the east, just one of a thousand purchases he had made in the last years.<br><br>There was no doubt he had been extravagant, spending gold and silver as if it had no value. He smiled at the thought, wondering what his father would have made of the white city rising in the wilderness. Genghis had despised the anthills of humanity, but these were not the ancient stones and teeming streets of an enemy. This was new and it belonged to the nation.<br><br>There had never been a treasury like the one he had inherited, amassed from the wealth of China and Khwarezm, yet never spent by its khan. With the tribute from Yenking alone, Ogedai could have sheathed every new home in white marble or even jade if he had wanted. He had built a monument to his father on the plains, as well as a place where he himself could be khan. He had built a palace with a tower that rose above the city like a white sword, so that all men could see the nation had come far from simple gers and herds.<br><br>For his gold, a million men had come to work. They had crossed plains and deserts with just a few animals and tools, coming from as far off as Chin lands or the cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, and Kabul. Masons and carpenters from Koryo had made the journey, called to the west by rumors of a new city being built on a river of coins. Bulgars brought stocks of rare clays, charcoal, and hardwood in great caravans from their forests. The city filled with traders, builders, potters, foodsellers, thieves, and scoundrels. Farmers scenting a profit brought their carts for days of travel, all for the strings of metal coins. Ogedai gave them gold and silver from the earth, melted and shaped. In return they gave him a city, and he did not find it a bad bargain. For the present, they were the colorful crowds of his city, speaking a hundred tongues and cooking a thousand different foods and spices. Some of them would be allowed to stay, but he was not building it for them.<br><br>Ogedai saw green-handed dyers flatten themselves against the walls, their red turbans dipping in respect. His Guards cleared the way ahead, so the son of Genghis could ride almost in a dream. He had made this place from the camp of gers his father had known. He had made it real, in stone.<br><br>It still amazed him. He had not paid for women to travel with his workers, but they had come with their husbands and fathers. He had wondered for a time how he would establish the businesses every city needed to thrive, but traders had approached his chancellor, offering horses or more silver to lease new properties. The city was more than a simple collection of houses. Already it had a vitality of its own, far beyond his control.<br><br>Yet not completely. A quirk in the plans had created an area of small alleyways in the south of his city. Criminal gangs had begun to flourish there until Ogedai heard. He had ordered eight hundred buildings torn down, the whole area redesigned and rebuilt. His own Guard had supervised the hangings.<br><br>The street fell quiet as he passed, the laborers and their masters bowing their heads as they saw the man who held the power of life and death and gold over all of them. Ogedai took a deep breath of the dusty air, enjoying the taste of it on his tongue and the thought that he was literally breathing in his creation. Ahead, he could see the towers of his palace, crowned in a dome of gold beaten thinner than the paper of his scribes. It raised his spirits to see it, like sunlight trapped and held in his city.<br><br>The street widened as it grew before him, its stone gutters polished. That section had been finished months before and the bustling crowds of laborers fell behind. As Ogedai trotted on, he could not help glancing at the boundary walls that had so confused his Chin architects and laborers. Even from the low vantage point of a saddle, there were moments when he could see over them to the green plains beyond. The walls of Yenking had not saved that city from fire or siege, he knew. His walls were the warriors of the khan, the tribes who had brought a Chin emperor to his knees and razed a shah's cities.<br><br>Already, Ogedai loved his creation, from the vast expanse of the central training ground, to the red-tiled roofs, the paved gutters, the temples and churches and mosques and markets and homes by the thousand, most still empty and waiting for life. Scraps of blue cloth fluttered in the plains wind on every corner, a tribute to the sky father above them all. In the south, green foothills and mountains stretched far away and the air was warm with dust as Ogedai rejoiced in Karakorum.<br><br>The twilight was deepening into a soft gloom as Ogedai handed his reins to a servant and strode up the steps to his palace. Before he entered, he looked back once more at the city straining to be born. He could smell fresh-turned earth and, over it, the fried food of the workmen on the evening air. He had not planned the herds of livestock in corrals beyond the walls, or the squawking chickens sold on every corner. He thought of the wool market that had sprung up by the western gate. He should not have expected trade to halt simply because the city was unfinished. He had chosen a spot on an ancient traders' road to give it life--and life had begun pouring in while whole streets, whole districts, were still piles of lumber, tile, and stone.<br><br>As he looked into the setting sun, he smiled at the cooking fires on the plains surrounding the city. His people waited there, for him. His armies would be fed on rich mutton, dripping fat from the summer grass. It reminded him of his own hunger, and he moistened his lips as he passed through a stone gate the equal of anything in a Chin city.<br><br>In the echoing hall beyond, he paused for a moment at his most extravagant gesture. A tree of solid silver stretched gracefully up to the arched ceiling, where the center point was open to the sky like the ger of any herdsman. It had taken the silversmiths of Samarkand almost a year to cast and polish, but it served his purpose. Whoever entered his palace would see it and be staggered at the wealth it represented. Some would see an emblem for the silver people, the Mongol tribes who had become a nation. Those with more wisdom would see that the Mongols cared so little for silver that they used it as a casting metal.<br><br>Ogedai let his hand slide down the bole of the tree, feeling the metal chill his fingers. The spreading branches reached out in a parody of life, gleaming like a white birch in moonlight. Ogedai nodded to himself. He stretched his back as lamps were lit by slaves and servants all around him, throwing black shadows and making the evening seem suddenly darker outside.<br><br>He heard hurrying footsteps and saw his manservant, Baras'aghur, approaching. Ogedai winced at the man's keen expression and the bundle of papers under his arm.<br><br>"After I have eaten, Baras. It has been a long day."<br><br>"Very well, my lord, but you have a visitor: your uncle. Shall I tell him to wait on your pleasure?"<br><br>Ogedai paused in the act of unbuckling his sword belt. All three of his uncles had come to the plains around Karakorum at his order, gathering their tumans in great camps. He had forbidden them all from entering the city, and he wondered who would have disobeyed him. He suspected it would be Khasar, who regarded orders and laws as tools for other men rather than himself.<br><br>"Who is it, Baras?" Ogedai asked quietly.<br><br>"Lord Temuge, master. I have sent servants to tend him, but he has been waiting now for a long time."<br><br>Baras'aghur made a gesture to indicate a sweep of the sun in the sky, and Ogedai pursed his lips in irritation. His father's brother would be well aware of the nuances of hospitality. Simply by arriving when Ogedai was not there to greet him, he had created an obligation. Ogedai assumed it was deliberate.

For two years, he had readied Karakorum to be the jewel in an empire. His had been a splendid isolation and he had maneuvered to keep it so, his enemies and friends always off balance.

Anyone unlucky enough to get in the way of his satirical sledgehammer will end up with soup for brains. Still, even Thompson needs a good villain to get properly lathered up; that's why he peaked simultaneously with America's 37th president, Richard Milhous Nixon. Tricky Dick was Thompson's dark-jowled, pale-calved Muse, and with his departure Thompson seemed to lose his place a bit. Swatting flies with a baseball bat. <p> You need look no further for this writer's best: this collection of pieces, first published in 1979, spans all of Thompson's primo era, including short pieces and selections from longer works. <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> sports a few articles filed by a pre-Gonzo Hunter S. Thompson, which show flickers of passion but no real fire; the first experiments with the author's drug-fueled brand of journalism at the Kentucky Derby; and finally the gigs that made him an American institution, in Las Vegas and on the 1972 campaign trail.</p><p> Thompson's style is so unique that a reader is tempted to think that he leapt, fully formed, into Gonzohood. However, along with the crazy, careening prose itself, one of the auxiliary pleasures of <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> is the map that it gives of Thompson's ascent (or descent, if you prefer) from the workaday hyperbole of sports writing to the hell-blast vigor of his later work. The drugs are, by and large, a distraction--lifestyle points that get in the way of the genuinely perceptive journalism that Thompson created. (But they are there, always, and in quantity.) If you're looking for insight into the underbelly of America, Hunter S. Thompson is your best and only guide, and <i>The Great Shark Hunt</i> is an excellent place to begin the grim safari. <i>--Michael Gerber</i></p>h all its warts, lies naked under the laser-like scrutiny of legendary outlaw journalist and brilliant reporter Hunter S. Thompson. Fearlessly, he hurls himself into each assignment, gouges out the truth, then returns with a fresh story no one else on earth could write. From Nixon to napalm, Las Vegas to Watergate, Carter to cocaine, hippies to himself, Thompson's razor-sharp insight and crystal clarity capture the crazy, hypocritical, degenerate, and redeeming aspects of the explosive and colorful '60s and '70s. Thompson is a rebel and an artist, and we are all richer for it.<br>"No other reporter reveals how much we have to fear and loathe, yet does it so hilariously."<br>-- Chicago Tribune</p><h2>Abel&#39;s Island</h2><p><br>Abel's place in his familiar, mouse world has always been secure; he had an allowance from his mother, a comfortable home, and a lovely wife, Amanda. But one stormy August day, furious flood water carry him off and dump him on an uninhabited island. Despite his determination and stubborn resourcefulness--he tried crossing the river with boats and ropes and even on stepping-stones--Abel can't find a way to get back home.<br><br>Days, then weeks and months, pass. Slowly, his soft habits disappear as he forages for food, fashions a warm nest in a hollow log, models clay statues of his family for company, and continues to brood on the problem of how to get across the river--and home.<br><br>Abel's time on the island brings him a new understanding of the world he's separated from. Faced with the daily adventure of survival in his solitary, somewhat hostile domain, he is moved to reexamine the easy way of life he had always accepted and discovers skills and talents in himself that hold promise of a more meaningful life, if and when he should finally return to Mossville and his dear Amanda again.<br><br></p><p>One summer day, newlywed mice Abel and Amanda are out for a picnic in the woods when they are caught in a sudden storm--a "full-fledged, screaming hurricane" to be precise. As they take refuge in a cave, a wind scoops up Amanda's scarf, and Abel foolishly lunges from safety to retrieve it. So begins William Steig's Newbery Honor Book <i>Abel's Island</i>, the ensuing adventures of this rather foppish mouse as he comes head to head with nature. Amazingly, Abel is swept up in a stream, then a river, then eventually marooned on an island (about 12,000 tails long). He is sure that his rescue is imminent: "It's certainly gotten around that Abelard Hassam di Chirico Flint, of the Mossville Flints, is missing," the society mouse speculates. But he is not so lucky. What will this intelligent, imaginative rodent do to get off the island and back to his beloved Amanda? He busies himself with finding ways to get to shore (including bridges, boats, catapults, stepping stones, and gliders); figuring out what he should eat (everything from mulberries to roasted seeds); and investigating where he should take shelter (in a rotten log). As the weeks and months go by, he misses his books, his paintings, his comfortable stuffed chair, his stylish clothes (now damp, torn, and lumpy), but above all his precious wife Amanda, whom he thinks about constantly. As the mouse faces his new life Robinson Crusoe-style, Abel discovers what it's like to be in tune with the natural world as well as his true nature, and what it's like to return, fortified, to his real home and to the arms of the one he loves. Along the way, readers can't help but rediscover the joys of being alive.

Six hundred years before Jesus came to earth, the Euphrates River Valley was home to the magnificent Babylonian Empire. The Babylonians had conquered the rest of the known world and brought untold numbers of people from the defeated kingdoms to Babylon as slaves.<br><br>Among the slaves was a youngman who was chosen byGod to become one of the greatest of the Hebrew prophets. God gave Daniel visions of the future and the ability to interpret dreams. While living in exile, Daniel recorded prophecies that some twenty-six centuries later give us a highly detailed look at our own future. Daniel saw the unfolding of human history and the days of Jesus Christ on earth. And as we will read in the chapters that follow, he saw the most detailed visions describing the end of the age&#x2013;the days that we are about to enter.<br><br>We live in prophetic times, so it is not surprising that the land of Babylon&#x2013; present-day Iraq and parts of present-day Iran&#x2013;is the focus of international tension and the subject of daily news reports. Iraq is torn by violent insurgencies, armed factions fighting for control of the country, and sectarian violence that continually causes injury and death. Foreign fighters, devoted to the cause of Al Qaeda and radical Islam, enter Iraq to join militant groups, to help train terrorists, to battle against Western allied forces, and to plot the demise of the State of Israel.<br><br><b>THE POWER OF ANCIENT BABYLON<br></b><br>The name Babylon still evokes a powerful image of the greatest city of the ancient world. The name is derived from <i>babel, </i>a Hebrew word meaning &#x201c;the gate of God.&#x201d; Located fifty-six miles south of modern-day Baghdad in Iraq, it rapidly grew in power until it became the most important city inthe ancient world. Babylon is in an area originally known by the name Sumer, or Shinar, designating the fertile country lying between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The land also was known as Mesopotamia, meaning &#x201c;the land between the rivers.&#x201d;<br><br>The first mention of Babylon in the Bible reveals that the city of Babel was founded by Nimrod, who was the son of Cush. &#x201c;Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD.... And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel&#x201d; (Genesis 10:8&#x2014;10). This was the site of the first widespread rebellion against God. The men of Babel built an enormous tower in an arrogant attempt to rebel against God and make themselves famous. &#x201c;And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth&#x201d; (Genesis 11:4). God&#x2019;s response was to &#x201c;confound their language, that they may not understand one another&#x2019;s speech&#x201d; (Genesis 11:7). In the confusion that resulted, &#x201c;the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city&#x201d; (Genesis 11:8). Scientists have verified the dispersion of humanity throughout three continents after the Flood (see Genesis 10:32; 11:8&#x2014;9).<br><br>History records that much later, around 1760 BC, King Hammurabi made Babylon the political and religious capital of his very powerful but small empire.Hammurabi combined astute diplomacy with superbmilitary leadership to defeat the surrounding kingdoms inMesopotamia.He was the first major king who created a written code of laws, known as the Code of Hammurabi. He became the ruler of the first united Babylonian Empire, which extended fromthe Persian Gulf to theHabur Rivermore than amillennium before the rise of the Babylonian Empire of Nebuchadnezzar.<br><br>In the seventh century BC, under King Nabopolassar and later his famous son, Nebuchadnezzar, the new empire of Babylon waged continuous wars against neighboring kingdoms, laying waste to cities and carrying countless numbers of people into captivity. Most notable among the millions of captives were the Judeans of Israel, who were taken in three phases between 606 BC and 587 BC.<br><br>Some historical sources conclude that Nebuchadnezzar conquered Judah in 605 BC. However, a careful reading of the Scriptures reveals that the correct date is actually 606 BC. The prophet Jeremiah recorded, &#x201c;The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon&#x201d; (Jeremiah 25:1). Jehoiakim&#x2019;s &#x201c;fourth year&#x201d; was 605 BC. However, Daniel declared that Jerusalem was taken by Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s army a year earlier, in the &#x201c;third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah&#x201d; (Daniel 1:1), which was the year 606 BC. The historian Henry Fynes Clinton also confirmed in his exhaustive chronological study of ancient history that Prince Nebuchadnezzar led his army against the Kingdom of Judah in the summer of 606 BC.<br><br>The Babylonian Empire did not endure for long, however. TheMedo- Persian Empire, led by the powerful kings Darius and Cyrus the Great, conquered the empire and the city of Babylon in 538 BC. But in the years that Nebuchadnezzar ruled the known world, God raised up Daniel, one of Israel&#x2019;s greatest prophets.<br><br><b>DANIEL&#x2019;S VISION OF OUR FUTURE<br></b><br>While serving in Babylon&#x2019;s royal courts, Daniel saw remarkable visions and interpreted inspired dreams. Many of his visions foretold the upheaval in the world that came to pass more than two thousand years ago. In fact, the fulfillment of those prophecies verifies that Daniel was truly God&#x2019;s prophet. His predictions came true exactly as they were given. However, many of Daniel&#x2019;s most intriguing prophecies describe events that are still to come. The generation that you and I are part of will see the fulfillment of these last-days prophecies.<br><br>In this book we will examine all of Daniel&#x2019;s prophecies&#x2013;the ones that were fulfilled long ago and those that are soon to be fulfilled. Our generation will witness the rise of the Antichrist and the False Prophet, the Tribulation period, the Antichrist&#x2019;s political and military domination of the world, the battle of Armageddon, and the return to earth of Jesus Christ. Daniel&#x2019;s ancient Babylonian prophecies give us a precise time line that reveals the sequence of events and the amount of time that will separate the major developments of the last days. It is certain that the events Daniel described will occur during the current generation.<br><br>If you know what to look for, you will see that signs of the last days are appearing all around us. I invite you to join me in this study of Daniel&#x2019;s prophecies. Together we will discover what the future holds for God&#x2019;s people, as well as for those who wage war against God.</p><h2>Henri Cartier-Bresson (Aperture Masters of Photography)</h2><p>The photography of Henri Cartier-Bresson has resulted in a body of work unique in the history of this craft, not alone in kind but in quality.

Good friends and sometime rivals William Fleisher, Frank Bender, and Richard Walter decided one day over lunch that something had to be done, and pledged themselves to a grand quest for justice. The three men invited the greatest collection of forensic investigators ever assembled, drawn from five continents, to the Downtown Club in Philadelphia to begin an audacious quest: to bring the coldest killers in the world to an accounting. Named for the first modern detective, the Parisian eug�ne Fran�ois Vidocq-the flamboyant Napoleonic real-life sleuth who inspired Sherlock Holmes-the Vidocq Society meets monthly in its secretive chambers to solve a cold murder over a gourmet lunch. <br><br> <i>The Murder Room</i> draws the reader into a chilling, darkly humorous, awe-inspiring world as the three partners travel far from their Victorian dining room to hunt the ruthless killers of a millionaire's son, a serial killer who carves off faces, and a child killer enjoying fifty years of freedom and dark fantasy. <br><br> Acclaimed bestselling author Michael Capuzzo's brilliant storytelling brings true crime to life more realistically and vividly than it has ever been portrayed before. It is a world of dazzlingly bright forensic science; true evil as old as the Bible and dark as the pages of Dostoevsky; and a group of flawed, passionate men and women, inspired by their own wounded hearts to make a stand for truth, goodness, and justice in a world gone mad.</p><p>Born in Boston and educated at Northwestern University, Michael Capuzzo is the author of the acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller <i>Close to Shore</i>, a historical thriller of the true story that inspired the novel and movie <i>Jaws</i>. Winner of many writing prizes as a staff reporter for <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i> and <i>The Miami Herald</i>, and for stories in magazines including <i>Sports Illustrated, Esquire</i> and <i>Life</i>, he lives in Pennsylvania, where he and his wife publish a prize-winning storytelling magazine, <i>Mountain Home</i>.<b>Chapter 1<br>The Connoisseurs of Murder</b><p>The great hall was filled with the lingering aroma of pork and mallard duck sausage as black-vested waiters appeared, shouldering cups of vanilla bean blancmange. Connoisseurs sat at tables between the hearths under glittering eighteenth-century chandeliers, chatting amiably in several languages. When the coffee arrived, a fine Colombian <i>supremo</i> steaming in its pots, the image of the corpse of a young man of uncommon beauty, lying on his back, materialized in the center of the room.</p><p>A gray winter light slanted into the hall, as the midday sun had sailed beyond the city, and the image on the large screen was crisp. The young man's blond locks were matted in a corona of dried blood, his sculpted cheekbones reduced to a pulp. The police photograph had been taken at night in a restaurant alley, and the surrounding scene was obscured in darkness. Yet the strobe light had thrown the young man's face into sharp relief. Out of the shadows of a distant southern night, the stark, wide-open eyes loomed over the room.</p><p>It was shortly before one o'clock in the afternoon, and the fifth and final course had been served to the connoisseurs of the Vidocq Society.</p><p>"My goodness," said a short-haired young woman in a red dress. Patting her mouth with a napkin, she excused herself from the table and, a hand over her mouth, hurried to the door. William Fleisher, a big man in a magnificent blue suit, <i>WLF</i> embroidered on his custom shirt, sadly shook his large, bearded head. "We need to do a better job screening guests," he said. Richard Walter, his gaunt cheekbones sunken in the wan light, glared at the departing figure. Frank Bender&#x2014;clad in a tight black T-shirt and jeans, the only man in the hall not wearing a suit&#x2014;whispered to the detective next to him, "Nice legs."</p><p>Fleisher shook his head in wonderment at the two eccentric, moody geniuses with whom he had thrown in his lot. His partners were criminologists without peer or precedent in his thirty years with the feds.</p><p>Forensic psychologist Richard Walter was the coolest eye on murder in the world. Tall and acerbic, he spoke with a clipped propriety that had earned him the moniker the Englishman from certain criminal elements. Walter had spent twenty years treating the most violent psychopaths in the state of Michigan at the largest walled penitentiary in the world, in Jackson, and at one of the toughest, the old Romanesque castle in Marquette on Lake Superior. His habit of peering over the top of his owlish black glasses and boring into the souls of inmates was known as the "Marquette stare," and it was a look to be avoided at all costs. He employed it to crack the fa�ade of psychopaths. Walter was unsurpassed in his understanding of the darkest regions of the heart. In his spare time, moonlighting as a consulting detective, he was one of the small group of American criminologists who invented modern criminal profiling in the 1970s and '80s to battle serial killers.</p><p>At Scotland Yard, which used him on the most extreme murder cases, he was known as the "Living Sherlock Holmes"&#x2014;an epithet that horrified him.</p><p>"Richard looks like Basil Rathbone in <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>," Fleisher said. "He talks like him, he thinks like him."</p><p>"Whenever someone says <i>that</i>," Walter said, "I look away and wait for the moment to pass, as if someone has just farted."</p><p>Frank Bender was the most celebrated forensic artist working at that time, perhaps in history. The wiry ex-boxer was muscled and balding, with a Van Dyke beard and piercing hazel eyes. For the occasion, he wore long sleeves that concealed his Navy tattoos. Bender, who grew up in tough North Philadelphia with bullets hitting the row house wall, was high school-educated, blunt-spoken, happily sex-addicted, and a psychic&#x2014;a gift he was shy about in the roomful of cops. But cops were awed by his ability to keep six or seven girlfriends happy as well as his wife, and to catch Most Wanted mass murderers with a sketchpad and scalpel. "Frank," Walter liked to tease him. "You would have been burned at the stake in the seventeenth century. Now you'll just get shot in the back."</p><p>The tall, melancholy, deductive Walter and the manic, intuitive Bender were blood brothers and partners on major cases. A detective duo without precedent, the psychologist and artist were capable of penetrating secrets of the living and the dead. When they could stand each other.</p><p>Bender saw dead people; Walter was contemptuous of spiritualism. The artist counted his sexual conquests in the hundreds; the psychologist, divorced, shrank from the touch of man, woman, child, dog, and cat. Walter was the most orderly mind on a murder, Bender the most chaotic.</p><p>William Lynn Fleisher was the glue that held the three together&#x2014;the one, friends said, "with a sail attached to the mast." The sartorial big man was the number two in charge of United States Customs law enforcement in three states, a world-class polygraph examiner and interrogator, a former FBI special agent, and an ex-Philadelphia beat cop. Fleisher was obsessed with the truth, had made himself a scholar of the history of truth-finding and an expert at distinguishing the truth from a lie. He used the polygraph to try to peer into the hearts of men to judge them, but really what he wanted to do was redeem them&#x2014;both the criminals whose psychophysiological signs spiked with guilt, and their tragic victims whose suffering society forgot. The big man, it was said by his special agents, had gained a hundred pounds to make room for his heart.</p><p>Bender and Walter were the most astonishing investigative team Fleisher had ever seen, equal parts reason and revelation, when they turned their combustible gifts on a killer and not on each other, like a man trying to extinguish his own shadow. The stout federal agent was the administrator who allowed them to take shape and function in the world.</p><p>They had met that morning in Bender's hall of bones, where a legendary and especially terrifying mob hit man had been the force that first brought them together, bonded in their fierce and awkward way, to create a private club of forensic avengers. Fleisher was sipping coffee with Bender at the kitchen table when the thin man entered the warehouse studio, nose wrinkled in disapproval "at the cat smells and whatever else."</p><p>"Richard!" Bender shouted, pumping Walter's hand enthusiastically, yet careful not to give a manly hug. "Let me show you my new painting!"</p><p>It was an enormous, brightly colored oil portrait of one of his many girlfriends, rendered in paint as thick as cake frosting. It was an eight-foot frontal nude; from the left nipple dangled a real brass ring.</p><p>"Chrissie has the cutest little butt," Bender said quietly, smiling as if visited by a wonderful memory.</p><p>Walter stood with his nose upturned, which pushed his mouth into a frown, studying the painting for a long moment.</p><p>"It's smut, Frank," he declared, turning away. "Simple smut." Bender howled with delight, as if there was no greater compliment. Walter glared at him. "Frank, Jesus Christ, you're almost sixty years old, and you're behaving like a fifteen-year-old Bolivian sex slave houseboy! You're using sex as an antidote to depression. As I have tried to explain, at our age it is not healthy for one to live as if one is poised before a mirror ringed with stage lights. One day the lights will go out and you will look in the mirror and see nothing at all.</p><p>"Now I'll take some coffee, black, if it's not too much trouble," Walter added. "I'm not fussy, so long as it wasn't boiled with a head."</p><p>Now with Fleisher in the great hall, Bender and Walter greeted each other warmly. The three men radiated an energy that seemed to animate the room. The habitual sadness in Fleisher's brown eyes lifted like a mist as he looked proudly across the gathering. All morning forensic specialists from around the globe had been quietly arriving at Second and Walnut streets in Philadelphia. They had gathered as they arrived in the high-ceilinged Coffee Room and Subscription Room on the first floor of the tavern, where colonists had once discussed politics, trade, and ship movements over the latest magazines and Franklin's <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>. Fleisher had felt the heady buzz of reunited friends, peers, and rivals. But now as he studied the assembly of sleuths from seventeen American states and eleven foreign countries, he sensed that something special was happening. Each man and woman was more renowned than the next.</p><p>There was FBI agent Robert Ressler, tall and silver-haired, who had confronted Charles Manson, John Wayne Gacy, and more "serial killers," a term he coined, than anyone in history. He was accepting congratulations, and no small amount of teasing, for <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>, the new hit movie featuring Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter being hunted by the FBI's Jack Crawford, a character based partly on Ressler. Ressler was never far from his cohort Richard Walter. They were two of the greatest profilers in the world.</p><p>Of equal distinction were the forensic pathologists. Their table included Dr. Hal Fillinger of Philadelphia, who had proven that the "Unicorn Killer," fugitive Ira Einhorn, had murdered his girlfriend Holly Maddux; Fillinger had arrived in his big white Cadillac with the "Homicide Hal" vanity plates. Next to him sat Dr. Richard Froede of Arizona, who would autopsy the remains of kidnapped CIA agent William Buckley, tortured, murdered, and dumped at a Beirut roadside by Islamic jihadists. Among the Philadelphia cops was Frank Friel, the former homicide captain who solved the 1981 assassination of mob underboss Philip "Chicken Man" Testa, immortalized in Bruce Springsteen's song "Atlantic City": "...they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night..." Fleisher saw noted investigators of the JFK and Martin Luther King assassinations, and a CIA friend who was leading the bureau's secret war on Afghanistan, sitting with a colleague, a young blond female "spook" who loathed to show her face in public, even here. At the French table, with the agents from Interpol in Lyon, sat the director of <i>Brigade de la S�ret�</i> in Paris, the French equivalent of the FBI. <i>S�ret�</i>, founded in 1811 by Vidocq, had been the very first state investigative agency, later inspiring the creation of the FBI and Scotland Yard.</p><p>The chamber on the second floor of the City Tavern was the historic Long Room, forty-four feet long and narrow with a soaring chapel ceiling, the first ballroom in the New World, where General George Washington had toasted his election to the presidency as cannons boomed across the city and Madeira glasses smashed. By modern standards it was austere, a pale green chamber with chair rails and candle sconces. But now it had been arranged to re-create the spirit of a second-floor chamber in Paris in 1833. In the upstairs room of No. 12 <i>rue Cloche-Perce</i>, Vidocq had run the first private detective agency in history, <i>Le Bureau des Renseignements</i> (Office of Information), seventeen years before the Pinkerton Agency was founded in the United States. It was the first room in history designed for a group of men to systematically deduce and brainstorm solutions to murder cases.</p><p>In the north corner of the room, overlooking the Delaware River, a bronze bust of Eug�ne Fran�ois Vidocq rested on an oak pedestal. The wide, arrogant face was stippled in shadows from the heavy green drapes, beneath crossed French and American flags. In the room at No. 12 <i>rue Cloche-Perce</i>, in the flickering shadows of hissing gaslights, Vidocq and his men kept intricate records to track criminals' patterns. They discussed motive and modus operandi in greater detail than ever before in history. They made plaster casts of shoe impressions and studied bullets to link them to crimes. They worked under paintings of Damiens being quartered, John the Baptist losing his head, and Ravaillac being tortured. They were the first modern criminologists. Convinced of their superior knowledge of the criminal mind, Vidocq had chosen them from the ranks of ex-convicts, like himself.</p><p>Each of the men and women at the long tables wore a redwhite-blue pin on their lapels&#x2014;<i>Les Couleurs</i>, the colors of France, the signature of their status as Vidocq Society Members (VSMs). There were eighty-two VSMs, one for each year of Vidocq's life. It was the world's most exclusive club, open, regardless of race, sex, age, or national origin, only to the best detectives and forensic scientists on the planet. They had been called the greatest gathering of forensic detectives ever assembled in one room. "No police agency in the world has the luxury of this kind of talent," Fleisher said. <i>The New York Times</i> declared the Vidocq Society "The Heirs of Holmes." "This is not a gathering of a ragtag bunch of Baker Street Irregulars playing dutiful amanuensis to Sherlock Holmes's genius," the <i>Times</i> said. "Nor are they a bunch of good-natured Archie Goodwins, filling the role of narrator and legman to the sedentary but brilliant Nero Wolfe in the mystery novels of Rex Stout...It is a group that collectively has hundreds of years of crime-solving experience."</p><p>The Vidocq Society's mission was simple and straightforward: As many as one in three murders in the United States went unsolved. It was a well of suffering scarcely known to the journalists who claimed crime was sensational and overblown, or the millions of Americans entertained nightly by it on TV. Murder was a scourge that had taken more than a million lives, more than most of the American wars ever fought in the twentieth century. Cops were overworked, departments underfunded; the criminal justice system favored the rights of criminals over victims. In a world that had forgotten its heroes, they resolved, by the light of a twelfth-century chivalric pledge, to hunt down murderers in cold cases, punish the guilty, free the innocent, and avenge, protect, and succor families victimized by murder. They resolved to work pro bono rather than swat a golf ball around in Florida or Arizona. They met on the third Thursday of every month; they were the Thursday Club. The eighty-two of them pledged themselves to their cause until death, when the rosette would be pinned on another man or woman chosen to fight for a better world.</p><p>The old Victorian brownstone on Locust Street in Philadelphia, headquarters of the Vidocq Society, was besieged with requests from around the world from cops and victims seeking an audience in the private chamber in City Tavern. A congressman who wanted to solve a murder in his family. A federal agent in Washington who needed another pair of eyes on the assassination of a woman agent in broad daylight while jogging. A young, small-town Tennessee cop overmatched by an elderly millionaire serial killer who moved from state to state killing his wives. But the Vidocq Society would not touch a case unless it was a murder, the victim had committed no crimes, and the case was at least two years old, officially a "cold case." "Our mission is to help the police at their request, working quietly in the background without fanfare, to act as an agent for justice," Fleisher said. In all cases, the society required the presence in th...</p></p><h2>The Sittaford Mystery</h2><p>When a blizzard strikes the village of Sittaford, the guests at Sittaford House gather for a seance that quickly turns into terror when a ouija board game warns of the impending murder of Captain Tevelyan, a prophecy that turns out to be only too true. Reissue.</p><p><p>In a remote house in the middle of Dartmoor, six shadowy figures huddle around a table for a seance. Tension rises as the spirits spell out a chilling message: "Captain Trevelyan . . . dead . . . murder."</p><p>Is this black magic or simply a macabre joke?

Tour.</p><p>Independent of her status as Mrs. Paul McCartney and former keyboard player/backup vocalist with the post-Beatles group Wings, McCartney has cultivated a successful photographic career. She is an intimate of the rock luminaries documented in this coffee-table album of 221 duotone and 32 color photographs, most of which were previously unpublished. A devotee of natural light and the spontaneous moment, the sum of McCartney's photographs--unlike the highly stylized and technically manipulated rock portraits of Annie Leibovitz--reflect a relaxed and unforced quality. Portraits include a 19-year-old Jackson Browne mugging, a stunning Jimi Hendrix in performance, Bob Dylan scratching his ear, Frank Zappa holding his baby daughter Moon Unit, and Janis Joplin hoisting a bottle of Southern Comfort. The photographs constitute a lush and lovely family album. More often than not, however, the author's accompanying text has the distracting presence of a boring slide show.

McCartney early on filched an invitation to a Rolling Stones party concert invitation and soon became the main lensperson at Manhattan's Fillmore East and on the road with top groups--Beatles, Stones, Doors, Cream, Jefferson Airplane et al. The photos show McCartney to have been a talented photojournalist, but her subjects here are so busy breaking rhythmic barriers, assuming attitudes, striking poses and being ungroomed that they are pictorial in their own right. Her accompanying recollections, including those of life with husband Paul and the Beatles, are uncluttered and minimally worshipful.

When America&#39;s financial structure crumbled, the damage proved to be not only deep, but wide. It took the crisis for the world to discover, to its horror, just how truly interconnected-and fragile-the global financial system is. The second part of the story explains how American and international government intervention kept us from a total meltdown. Many of the U.S. government&#39;s actions, particularly the Fed&#39;s, were previously unimaginable. And to an amazing-and certainly misunderstood-extent, they worked. The worst did not happen. Blinder offers clear-eyed answers to the questions still before us, even if some of the choices ahead are as divisive as they are unavoidable. After the Music Stopped is an essential history that we cannot afford to forget, because one thing history teaches is that it will happen here again.</p><p>Alan S. Blinder is the Gordon S. Rentschler Memorial Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and the vice chairman of the Promontory Interfinancial Network, a financial services firm based in Arlington, Virginia. He served as the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s Board of Governors from 1994 to 1996 and was a member of President Clinton&#x2019;s Council of Economic Advisers. He writes a regular monthly op-ed column for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and appears frequently on PBS, CNBC, CNN, Bloomberg TV, and elsewhere.<b><i>The Wall Street Journal</i>:</b><br>"<b>[Blinder] is a master storyteller...

Mr. Blinder draws on the work of many... reporters in his account. But if large portions of <i>After the Music Stopped</i> feel familiar, the book nonetheless benefits from its wide-angle perspective, as well as from its vantage point in time, now that it's possible to assess the fallout of decisions that were being made on the run by White House and Treasury officials under extraordinary pressures. <b>It also benefits from Mr. Blinder's clear-eyed prose and nimble gifts as an explainer &#x2014; gifts that sometimes approach those of Bill Clinton, when it comes to making complicated economic issues and policies understandable to the lay reader.

A lot, actually. Blinder is no defender of his economist colleagues or other former and current insiders who caused so much damage&nbsp;- or, at minimum, failed to see the collapse on the horizon.

Volcker:</b><br>"True to his scholarly roots and informed by his practical insights, Alan Blinder has produced in <i>After the Music Stopped </i>both a comprehensive and, mirabile dictu, engagingly readable analysis of the great financial crisis.

He&#x2019;s not, but from his hospital bed, he unspools into a cassette recorder a tale of self-determination, from village idiot to man of the world, for the benefit of his unborn son. </p><p>Written in an astonishingly charming and wise voice, <i>Panorama City</i> traces forty days and nights navigating the fast food joints, storefront churches, and home-office psychologists of the San Fernando Valley. Ping-ponging between his watchful and sharp-tongued aunt and an outlaw philosopher with the face "of a newly hatched crocodile," Oppen finds himself constantly in the sights of people who believe that their way is the only way for him. </p><p>Open-hearted, bicycle-riding, binocular-toting Oppen Porter is "an American original" (Stewart O'Nan) for whom finding one's own way is both a delightful art and a painstaking science. Disarmingly funny and surreptitiously moving, <i>Panorama City</i> makes us see the world, and our place in it, with new eyes. <br>&nbsp; <br></p></p><p><p><b>Author One-on-One: Antoine Wilson and Curtis Sittenfeld</b></p> <p><strong>Curtis Sittenfeld</strong><strong> is the author of <em>American Wife</em>, <em>The Man of My Dreams</em> and <em>Prep</em>, which was chosen by <i>The New York Times</i> as one of the Ten Best Books of 2005. Read her exclusive Amazon guest review of <i>Panorama City</i>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Curtis Sittenfeld: </strong>Oppen Porter is endearing and often insightful, and he also has significant cognitive disabilities. How did you decide you wanted to tell his story?</p> <p><strong>Antoine Wilson:</strong> I wanted to write a novel from the perspective of someone who seemed, on the surface, to be a fool, an idiot, a doofus. I was inspired by Sancho Panza and Candide. But I let Oppen do something those forebears weren&#x2019;t able to do: speak for himself, in his own voice. As for his so-called cognitive disabilities (he&#x2019;s illiterate and preternaturally na�ve), they provide a kind of detour around two distractions of contemporary life&#x2014;information overload and mistrust of others&#x2014;to arrive at something essential and true. </p> <p><strong>CS: </strong>Do you feel as if you know how a doctor would diagnose Oppen? If so, why did you choose not to mention what that diagnosis would be?</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> I don&#x2019;t believe in diagnosing literary characters. As useful as diagnoses can be in real life, they tend to reduce even living, breathing human beings into a list of symptoms and treatments. Apply that kind of constricting language to a literary character&#x2014;who is after all only a cluster of words&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s like letting the air out of a balloon.</p> <p><strong>CS: </strong>Oppen has many entertaining philosophies about the world and its inhabitants. Are any of his views ones you especially share?</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Most problems can be solved by waiting. People who walk with their arms swinging look like apes.</p> <p><strong>CS: </strong>Much of the book is, directly and indirectly, about father-son relationships. Could you have written this novel if you weren&#x2019;t a father yourself?</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> While I was writing this book, my father died and my son was born. Never before have I felt so much like a link in the chain of generations. It&#x2019;s no coincidence that Oppen finds himself in the same position, with a father just dead and a little boy on the way. I didn&#x2019;t approach Panorama City as a transcript of my experience, obviously, but without these experiences I would never have written this particular book.</p> <p><strong>CS: </strong>Oppen finds himself in some interesting sub-communities, including as an employee of a fast food restaurant and a member of a Christian fellowship, and you depict these settings very convincingly. Do you have personal experience with them? Did you do research to get your details right?</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> I have had enough personal experience with those sub-communities that what little research I did came after the draft was done, in the form of a kind of fiction-writer fact-checking. I&#x2019;m not a research-first kind of novelist, mainly because I have trouble injecting facts into the part of my brain that generates fictional worlds.</p> <p><strong>CS: </strong>On a similar note, did you spend much time in Panorama City while writing this novel? Would a resident recognize the city, or did you fictionalize it?</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Any resident of the San Fernando Valley (or greater Los Angeles) would recognize the world of Panorama City, I'm certain. There&#x2019;s a Babies R Us in Panorama City, so I tended to kill two birds with one stone, parental duties and novel research. The setting is not 1:1 with the real world, though, so there won&#x2019;t be any Ulysses-type walking tours, I&#x2019;m afraid. Maybe for the next book.</p> <p>I shot a lot of photographs, too. Some went into a book, Shopping Carts of Panorama City, by my alter ego Jean-Jacques Arsenault.</p> <p><strong>CS: </strong>In addition to writing fiction, you maintain a few side projects on your website, including the oddly fascinating "Slow Paparazzo," which shows photos that purport to be places celebrities have just left. Is this really, as the site claims, &#x201c;100% for reals,&#x201d; and can you explain its genesis?</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Slow Paparazzo (http://theywerejusthere.tumblr.com) is indeed &#x201c;100% for reals!&#x201d; Basically I kept seeing celebrities while I was out for the day, mostly around my writing office, which is on the border of Santa Monica and Brentwood. I got a kick out of my sightings but didn't want to skeeve out the famous people, so I started tweeting them as #mentalpaparazzo. Then, after nearly walking into Dave Grohl outside our local toy store, I thought I should take a picture of where he&#x2019;d just been and tweet that. That was the genesis. A Slow Paparazzo book is in the works.</p>&#x201c;This is a book you will hold in your head all day long, a book you will look forward to when you get home from work, a book you will still be savoring as you drift into sleep. <i>Panorama City</i> is often very funny.

My second husband&#x2014;so different from the first one&#x2014;was a man of warm good humor from the time he got out of bed until he got back in it. That had been somewhat of a surprise to me, having been accustomed to steering carefully around a bristly, short-tempered husband every morning for forty-something years. Having watched my step and my words for that long had turned me into a woman of cool temperament with few smiles&#x2014;and stiff ones, at that&#x2014;before coffee was poured.<br><br> "Mornin', Mr. Sam," Lillian said as she stood beside the stove. "Eggs 'bout ready."<br><br> "Good morning," I responded but without the bouncing eagerness with which he started the day.<br><br> "Julia," Sam said as he sat at the kitchen table, "I have had an epiphany."<br><br> "A what?"<br><br> "An epiphany. You know, a sudden flash of enlightenment." He accepted the cup of coffee I'd just poured, then said, "Well, maybe it's more of a bright idea. What do you think of going to the beach for a couple of weeks?"<br><br> "The <i>beach</i>? Why, Sam, you and Lloyd and Mr. Pickens just got back from the beach. Why in the world would you want to go back?"<br><br> "That wasn't a beach trip. We went deep-sea fishing and stepped from a dock to a boat and back again every day without being on the beach at all. No, I'm talking about renting an oceanfront house on one of the islands out from Charleston and just enjoying the sun and the waves and the ocean breeze. And there'll be shopping in Charleston and a lot of good seafood dinners&#x2014;a real vacation for everybody, especially you. You've done nothing this summer but worry with Miss Mattie's affairs. You need a break, sweetheart.<br><br> "And, think of this, Julia. Think of sitting out on a screened porch overlooking the Atlantic and watching the sun go down."<br><br> I looked at him from under lowered brows. "More like watching the sun come <i>up</i>. Last I checked, we'd be facing east."<br><br> He laughed. "Just testing you, honey. But what do you say? Lloyd and Latisha will be back in school in a couple of weeks, and August is always a slow month. Let's rent a huge house and take everybody."<br><br> "<i>Who</i> everybody?"<br><br> "Everybody who wants to go&#x2014;the Pickens family, the Bates family, Lillian and Latisha, Miss Wiggins, if you want, you, me, and Lloyd, and anybody else you want to ask."<br><br> "My word, Sam, you'd need a hotel for a crew like that."<br><br> "No, no. I've been looking online, and there're a few big houses&#x2014;nice houses&#x2014;still available. How many bedrooms would we need?"<br><br> "One for you and me, for sure. I'm not sharing with anybody else."<br><br> He laughed again, passed the cream pitcher to me, and thanked Lillian as she set his plate before him. "Let's count them up. I think five bedrooms would do it, though six might be better. Maybe put all the children together in one&#x2014;they'd like that, wouldn't they?"<br><br> "Probably so, to start with at least. Then there'd be little feet pattering all over the house looking for their mamas. But, Sam," I went on, "August is an active hurricane month. What if we're there when a hurricane blows in?"<br><br> "Honey," Sam said, smiling with indulgence at my concern, "we'd pack up and leave long before it hit the coast. I tell you what&#x2014;I'll check the Weather Channel every day and keep you fully updated."<br><br> I smiled and nodded. Then, realizing that Lillian had been noticeably silent during all this, I said, "What do you think, Lillian? Would you and Latisha like to go?"<br><br> "Yes'm, I guess we could," she said, busying herself at the sink. "Latisha, she never seen the ocean, so she would. But me, I could pro'bly take it or leave it." Latisha, Lillian's great-grandchild, had lived with her for a number of years. Bright as a new penny and full of energy, she kept Lillian hopping, so it occurred to me that Lillian herself could use a vacation&#x2014;not just days off, but a real get-out-of-town vacation. Sam's bright idea suddenly seemed made to order.<br><br> "Well, what about James?" Sam asked, bringing up the touchy subject of the man who'd worked for Sam before we married and who now cooked for Hazel Marie and Mr. Pickens. "Think he'd want to go?"<br><br> "Nobody never know what he want," Lillian mumbled as she ran water into the egg skillet.<br><br> I shook my head at Sam, warning him off. "Let's just think about James. He can be hard to get along with at times."<br><br> "That be the truth," Lillian agreed with some force.<br><br> "Well," Sam went on with unflagging enthusiasm, "the first thing we have to do is find out how many want to go. Then I'll know how big a house we'll need. I'll start with Pickens and see what he says."<br><br> "All right," I said, "but, Sam, it's awfully late in the season to be looking for a rental. So I want to say right now that if you can't find a nice one, I'm not going. I don't want to either camp out or try to make do with the dregs of the rental market."<br><br> "Oh, I agree," he said, standing. "We'll do it right or not at all." And off he went, as happy as a clam&#x2014;an expression I thought appropriate for the subject at hand.<br><br> "Come sit with me, Lillian," I said. "There's still some coffee in the pot." When she'd settled at the table, I went on, "Now tell me what you really think about this bright idea."<br><br> "Well, Miss Julia, I guess goin' to the beach won't never be my first choice&#x2014;they's things in that ocean. But I'll go, 'cause y'all need somebody to cook, an' Latisha never let me forget it if she don't get to go."<br><br> "No, Lillian, I'm not thinking that way. I wouldn't ask you to cook three meals a day for as many people as Sam has in mind. That wouldn't be a vacation for you at all. I expect there're plenty of good cooks who hire out by the week for renters. No, I'm talking about your going just for the rest and the fun of it."<br><br> Lillian reared back at the thought. "With somebody else in the kitchen? No'm, I don't know 'bout eatin' somebody else's cookin' while I set around watchin'. I wouldn't know what to do with myself."<br><br> "Well, let's think about it. I don't want you having to cook for an army for days on end&#x2014;we'd have to bring you home on a stretcher. Let's wait and see how many Sam can talk into going. To tell the truth, it wouldn't surprise me if nobody wants to go, and if that's the case, Sam's bright idea will get dim in a hurry."<br><br> Which, to be honest, wouldn't bother me at all. Oh, I'd hate for Sam to be disappointed, but let's face it&#x2014;I hadn't lost one thing at the beach. My sweet, generous Sam, with his good heart and itchy feet, was always planning a trip to somewhere. Why, he'd even been to Russia, and a year or so ago, he'd wanted to float down the Rhine, and another time he'd gotten a bee in his bonnet about looking up ancestors in Scotland. And he always wanted me to go with him, although, as should be apparent by now, I wasn't the traveling kind.<br><br> So, considering the many times I'd turned him down while urging him to pursue his dreams, I felt that I could and should agree to a beach trip. What was it&#x2014;two hundred or so miles from home? I could manage that for a couple of weeks, even though I am essentially a homebound, routine-loving, day-in and day-out kind of woman.<br><br> Ah, well, I sighed. For Sam's sake I could put up with a week or so of a house full of noisy children, occasional ill tempers, wet bathing suits, lumpy mattresses, and sand tracked in everywhere.<br><br> Maybe I'd never have to do it again.<br><br> Chapter 2<br><br> I found Sam in the library, which had once been the downstairs bedroom but was now decked out in Williamsburg paint colors, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, and eighteenth-century furniture. Reproductions, but still.<br><br> Making a note on a pad as he put down the phone, Sam looked up at me. "I think the Pickenses will go. Hazel Marie's excited about it, but she has to speak to J.D. She'll call back after they talk it over."<br><br> I nodded, but as I started to speak, the phone on the desk rang. "Hold on, honey," Sam said, as he reached for it. "It's Binkie, returning my call."<br><br> I sat on the leather Chippendale sofa, mentally counting Hazel Marie, Mr. Pickens, Lloyd, and the twin toddlers. Five of them, with Sam and me making seven. Nine if Lillian and Latisha went, eight if Lillian didn't.<br><br> As Sam's conversation with Binkie went on in the background, I thought of my curly-headed lawyer. I hadn't seen much of her lately as the estate Lloyd and I equally inherited from Wesley Lloyd Springer&#x2014;my first, unfaithful and unlamented, husband&#x2014;had been perking along quite well in Binkie's capable hands, especially with Sam's occasional advice. She had taken over Sam's law practice when he retired to begin his tortuous way to writing a legal history of Abbot County.<br><br> Binkie Enloe Bates was married to Coleman Bates, a sergeant in the Abbot County Sheriff's Department, a union which had begun in my living room when she had come running in soaked to the skin by a sudden summer shower. Coleman, my roomer at the time, had been smitten at once, and from all evidence I could see, remained that way. Little Gracie was their daughter.<br><br> So the Bates family would, if they accepted Sam's invitation, make three more beachgoers. Either eleven or twelve in all, still depending on Lillian's decision.<br><br> Then my thoughts drifted from one possible beachgoer to another as an image of Hazel Marie's sweet face formed in my mind. I'd seen so little of her recently, having been taken up with settling the estate of an acquaintance who'd obviously thought more of me than I had of her. Not that I'd disliked Mattie Freeman; it was just that I'd hardly thought of her at all, and to have been named executor of her will had been both shocking and remarkably time consuming. To be away from the constant concern about getting her last wishes through probate and put to rest, as she had been, was something devoutly to be desired.<br><br> But, back to Hazel Marie, as Sam's conversation with Binkie went on; what a change in that young woman. Well, not so young, unless compared to some whom we won't mention. I recalled the first time I'd seen her&#x2014;knocking at my door, looking to my mind like a street harlot, as she introduced the skinny, freckled-faced urchin beside her as my recently deceased husband's only child. Lord, what a shock to my system! Wesley Lloyd Springer had been the wealthiest, most dogmatic and upright member of the First Presbyterian Church of Abbotsville&#x2014;when he spoke, Pastor Ledbetter listened.<br><br> And standing right out there on my front porch was his longtime mistress and illegitmate son; and as if that hadn't been bad enough, come to find out that half the town had known of his extramarital activities. And that half had not included me&#x2014;talk about having to live something down! But I'd done it, taking both mother and child under my wing and into my home and daring the town to snub either them or me. Money talks, don't you know, and Wesley Lloyd had left plenty, even when shared with Lloyd. It hadn't taken long to change a number of tunes.<br><br> Over the years, though, Hazel Marie, under my tutelage, had evolved into a classic young matron, well thought of around town, safely married, and the mother not only of Lloyd&#x2014;the light of my life in spite of where he'd come from&#x2014;but also of twin toddlers, courtesy of Mr. J. D. Pickens, PI, who had immeasurably improved his standing with me by adopting Lloyd.<br><br> "Julia?" Sam's voice broke into my reverie. "You all right, honey?"<br><br> "Oh. Yes, just daydreaming. What did Binkie say?"<br><br> "Well," he said, patently pleased with himself, "it just so happens that both she and Coleman have some time off coming. They were halfway planning a camping trip, but she likes the idea of going to the beach. Little Gracie is just old enough to enjoy it. So Binkie will talk to Coleman and let me know. But she said to count them in."<br><br> I laughed. "Coleman will do whatever she wants. I just hope the sheriff's department can get along without him for a few days."<br><br> "He's well thought of over there, that's for sure."<br><br> "Sam," I said, thoughtfully, so as to indicate a change of subject, "I'm a little concerned about Lillian. I don't think she wants to go, even though I assured her that it would be a vacation and not two weeks of extra work. But she knows Latisha will want to go and she doesn't want to disappoint her."<br><br> "Then let's take Latisha with us, and Lillian can have some real time off."<br><br> "What a good idea," I said, even though I'd already thought of it. "But that means we'll have to be extra careful keeping an eye on her. All the other children will have mamas and daddies watching out for them."<br><br> "We'll set some rules, and the first one will be no going to the beach alone. But, Julia, how would she do without Lillian? I doubt she's ever spent a night away from her great-granny."<br><br> "She'll have Lloyd and she adores him, and besides, we'll make sure before we leave that she really wants to go. Actually, though," I went on, thinking it through, "it'll probably be the other way around. Lillian may not be able to spend a night away from her."<br><br> "Well, see what she says. Lillian needs some time for herself, and we'll all watch Latisha. She's never any trouble when she's here, so I'm sure she'll be fine." Then with a few clicks at the computer, he said, "Come over here, honey, and let me show you what I found."<br><br> I leaned over his shoulder to view the picture of a large yellow house with white trim. "Oceanfront," Sam said, "and three, actually four, stories. Two bedroom suites on the main floor on opposite sides of the house, four suites on the second floor, and a huge dormitory room on the top floor. Oh, and there're two maid's rooms with a bath on the ground floor. See, the house sits on pilings, so the main floor is really the second. That's to get the ocean breeze through the living space and to give an ocean view over the dunes."</p><h2>The Corinthian</h2><p>Fugitive heiress Penelope Creed is torn between Piers Luttrell, her childhood sweetheart, and Sir Richard Wyndham, a worldly London dandy. Reprint.</p><p>The late Georgette Heyer was a very private woman. Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. <br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>The company, ushered by a disapproving butler into the yellow saloon of Sir Richard Wyndham's house in St James's Square, comprised two ladies and one reluctant gentleman. The gentleman, who was not much above thirty years of age, but sadly inclined to fat, seemed to feel the butler's disapproval, for upon that dignified individual's informing the elder of the two ladies that Sir Richard was not at home, he cast a deprecating glance at him, not in the least the glance of a peer of the realm upon a menial, but an age-old look of one helpless man to another, and said in a pleading tone: &#x2018;Well, then, don't you think, Lady Wyndham ? Louisa, hadn't we better ? I mean, no use going in, my love, is there?'</p> <p>Neither his wife nor his mother-in-law paid any attention to this craven speech. &#x2018;If my brother is gone out, we will await his return,' said Louisa briskly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Your poor Papa was always out when one wanted him,' complained Lady Wyndham. &#x2018;It is very affecting to me to see Richard growing every day more like him.'</p> <p>Her fading accents were so lachrymose that it seemed probable that she would dissolve into tears upon her son's doorstep. George, Lord Trevor, was uneasily aware of a handkerchief, clutched in one thin, gloved hand, and put forward no further objection to entering the house in the wake of the two ladies.</p> <p>Declining all offers of refreshment, Lady Trevor escorted her parent into the Yellow Saloon, settled her comfortably upon a satin sofa, and announced her intention of remaining in St James's Square all day, if need be. George, with a very clear idea, born of sympathy, of what would be his brother-in-law's emotions upon returning to his residence to find a family deputation in possession of it, said unhappily: &#x2018;You know, I don't think we should, really I don't! I don't like it above half. I wish you would drop this notion you've taken into your heads.'</p> <p>His wife, who was engaged in stripping off her lavender-kid gloves, threw him a look of indulgent contempt. &#x2018;My dear George, if you are afraid of Richard, let me assure you that I am not.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Afraid of him! No, indeed! But I wish you will consider that a man of nine-and-twenty won't relish having his affairs meddled with. Besides, he will very likely wonder what the deuce it has to do with me, and I'm sure I can't tell him! I wish I had not come.'</p> <p>Louisa ignored this remark, considering it unworthy of being replied to, which indeed it was, since she ruled her lord with a rod of iron. She was a handsome woman, with a great deal of decision in her face, and a leavening gleam of humour. She was dressed, not perhaps in the height of fashion, which decreed that summer gauzes must reveal every charm of a lady's body, but with great elegance and propriety. Since she had a very good figure, the prevailing mode for high-waisted dresses, with low-cut bodices, and tiny puff-sleeves, became her very well: much better, in fact, than skin-tight pantaloons, and a long-tailed coat became her husband.</p> <p>Fashion was not kind to George. He looked his best in buckskin breeches and top-boots, but he was unfortunately addicted to dandyism, and pained his friends and relatives by adopting every extravagance of dress, spending as much time over the arrangement of his cravat as Mr Brummell himself, and squeezing his girth into tight stays which had a way of creaking whenever he moved unwarily.</p> <p>The third member of the party, reclining limply on the satin sofa, was a lady with quite as much determination as her daughter, and a far more subtle way of getting her wishes attended to. A widow of ten years' standing, Lady Wyndham enjoyed the frailest health. The merest hint of opposition was too much for the delicate state of her nerves; and anyone, observing her handkerchief, her vinaigrette, and the hartshorn which she usually kept by her, would have had to be stupid indeed to have failed to appreciate their sinister message. In youth, she had been a beauty; in middle age, everything about her seemed to have faded: hair, cheeks, eyes, and even her voice, which was plaintive, and so gentle that it was a wonder it ever made itself heard. Like her daughter, Lady Wyndham had excellent taste in dress, and since she was fortunate enough to possess a very ample jointure she was able to indulge her liking for the most expensive fal-lals of fashion without in any way curtailing her other expenses. This did not prevent her from thinking herself very badly off, but she was able to enjoy many laments over her straitened circumstances without feeling the least real pinch of poverty, and to win the sympathy of her acquaintances by dwelling sadly on the injustice of her late husband's will, which had placed his only son in the sole possession of his immense fortune. The jointure, her friends deduced hazily, was the veriest pittance.</p> <p>Lady Wyndham, who lived in a charming house in Clarges Street, could never enter the mansion in St James's Square without suffering a pang. It was not, as might have been supposed from the look of pain she always cast upon it, a family domicile, but had been acquired by her son only a couple of years before. During Sir Edward's lifetime, the family had lived in a much larger, and most inconvenient house in Grosvenor Square. Upon Sir Richard's announcement that he proposed to set up an establishment of his own, this had been given up, so that Lady Wyndham had been able ever since to mourn its loss without being obliged to suffer any longer its inconveniences. But however much she might like her own house in Clarges Street it was not to be supposed that she could bear with equanimity her son's inhabiting a far larger house in St James's Square; and when every other source of grievance failed her, she always came back to that, and said, as she said now, in an ill-used voice: &#x2018;I cannot conceive what he should want with a house like this!'</p> <p>Louisa, who had a very good house of her own, besides an estate in Berkshire, did not in the least grudge her brother his mansion. She replied: &#x2018;It doesn't signify, Mama. Except that he must have been thinking of marriage when he bought it. Would you not say so, George?'</p> <p>George was flattered at being thus appealed to, but he was an honest, painstaking person, and he could not bring himself to say that he thought Richard had had any thought of marriage in his head, either when he had bought the house, or at any other time.</p> <p>Louisa was displeased. &#x2018;Well!' she said, looking resolute, &#x2018;he must be brought to think of marriage!'</p> <p>Lady Wyndham lowered her smelling-salts to interpolate: &#x2018;Heaven knows I would never urge my boy to do anything distasteful, but it has been an understood thing for years that he and Melissa Brandon would seal the long friendship between our families with the Nuptial Tie!'</p> <p>George goggled at her, and wished himself otherwhere.</p> <p>&#x2018;If he doesn't wish to marry Melissa, I'm sure I should be the last person to press her claim,' said Louisa. &#x2018;But it is high time that he married someone, and if he has no other suitable young female in his eye, Melissa it must be.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I do not know how to face Lord Saar,' bemoaned Lady Wyndham, raising the vinaigrette to her nose again. &#x2018;Or poor dear Emily, with three girls besides Melissa to dispose of, and none of them more than passable. Sophia has spots, too.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I do not consider Augusta hopeless,' said Louisa fairly. &#x2018;Amelia, too, may improve.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Squints!' said George.</p> <p>&#x2018;A slight cast in one eye,' corrected Louisa. &#x2018;However, we are not concerned with that. Melissa is an extremely handsome creature. No one can deny that!'</p> <p>&#x2018;And such a desirable connection!' sighed Lady Wyndham. &#x2018;Quite one of the best families!'</p> <p>&#x2018;They tell me Saar won't last another five years, not at the rate he's going now,' said George. &#x2018;Everything mortgaged up to the hilt, and Saar drinking himself into his grave! They say his father did the same.'</p> <p>Both ladies regarded him with disfavour. &#x2018;I hope, George, you do not mean to imply that Melissa is addicted to the bottle?' said his wife.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh no, no! Lord, no, I never thought of such a thing! I'm sure she's an excellent young woman. But this I will say, Louisa: I don't blame Richard if he don't want her!' said George defiantly. &#x2018;Myself, I'd as soon marry a statue!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I must say,' conceded Louisa, &#x2018;she is a trifle cold, perhaps. But it is a very delicate position for her, you'll allow. It has been understood since both were children that she and Richard would make a match of it, and she knows that as well as we do. And here is Richard, behaving in the most odious way! I am out of all patience with him!'</p> <p>George rather liked his brother-in-law, but he knew that it would be foolhardy to defend him, so he held his peace. Lady Wyndham took up the tale of woe. &#x2018;Heaven forbid that I should force my only son to a disagreeable marriage, but I live in hourly dread of his bringing home some dreadful, low-born creature on his arm, and expecting me to welcome her!'</p> <p>A vision of his brother-in-law crossed George's mind's eye. He said doubtfully: &#x2018;Really, you know, I don't think he'll do that, ma'am.'</p> <p>&#x2018;George is quite right,' announced Louisa. &#x2018;I should think the better of Richard if he did. It quite shocks me to see him so impervious to every feminine charm! It is a great piece of nonsense for him to dislike the opposite sex, but one thing is certain: dislike females he may, but he owes a duty to the name, and marry he must! I am sure I have been at pains to introduce him to every eligible young woman in town, for I am by no means set on his marrying Melissa Brandon. Well! He would not look twice at any of them, so if that is the mind he is in, Melissa will suit him very well.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Richard thinks they all want him for his money,' ventured George.</p> <p>&#x2018;I dare say they may. What has that to say to anything, pray? I imagine you do not mean to tell me that Richard is romantic!'</p> <p>No, George was forced to admit that Richard was not romantic.</p> <p>&#x2018;If I live to see him suitably married, I can die content!' said Lady Wyndham, who had every expectation of living for another thirty years. &#x2018;His present course fills my poor mother's heart with foreboding!'</p> <p>Loyalty forced George to expostulate. &#x2018;No, really, ma'am! Really, I say! There's no harm in Richard, not the least in the world, 'pon my honour!'</p> <p>&#x2018;He puts me out of all patience!' said Louisa. &#x2018;I love him dearly, but I despise him with all my heart! Yes, I do, and I do not care who hears me say so! He cares for nothing but the set of his cravat, the polish on his boots, and the blending of his snuff!'</p> <p>&#x2018;His horses!' begged George unhappily.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, his horses! Very well! Let us admit him to be a famous whip! He beat Sir John Lade in their race to Brighton! A fine achievement indeed!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Very handy with his fives!' gasped George, sinking but game.</p> <p>&#x2018;You may admire a man for frequenting Jackson's Saloon, and Cribb's Parlour! I do not!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, my love,' George said. &#x2018;No, indeed, my love!'</p> <p>&#x2018;And I make no doubt you see nothing reprehensible in his addiction to the gaming-table! But I had it on the most excellent authority that he dropped three thousand pounds at one sitting at Almack's!'</p> <p>Lady Wyndham moaned, and dabbed at her eyes. &#x2018;Oh, do not say so!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, but he's so devilish wealthy it can't signify!' said George.</p> <p>&#x2018;Marriage,' said Louisa, &#x2018;will put a stop to such fripperies.'</p> <p>The depressing picture this dictum conjured up reduced George to silence. Lady Wyndham said, in a voice dark with mystery: &#x2018;Only a mother could appreciate my anxieties. He is at a dangerous age, and I live from day to day in dread of what he may do!'</p> <p>George opened his mouth, encountered a look from his wife, shut it again, and tugged unhappily at his cravat.</p> <p>The door opened; a Corinthian stood upon the threshold, cynically observing his relatives. &#x2018;A thousand apologies,' said the Corinthian, bored but polite. &#x2018;Your very obedient servant, ma'am. Louisa, yours! My poor George! Ah was I expecting you?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Apparently not!' retorted Louisa, bristling.</p> <p>&#x2018;No, you weren't. I mean, they took it into their heads I couldn't stop them!' said George heroically.</p> <p>&#x2018;I thought I was not,' said the Corinthian, closing the door, and advancing into the room. &#x2018;But my memory, you know, my lamentable memory!'</p> <p>George, running an experienced eye over his brother-in-law, felt his soul stir. &#x2018;B'gad, Richard, I like that! That's a devilish well-cut coat, 'pon my honour, it is! Who made it?'</p> <p>Sir Richard lifted an arm, and glanced at his cuff. &#x2018;Weston, George, only Weston.'</p> <p>&#x2018;George!' said Louisa awfully.</p> <p>Sir Richard smiled faintly, and crossed the room to his mother's side. She held out her hand to him, and he bowed over it with languid grace, just brushing it with his lips. &#x2018;A thousand apologies, ma'am!' he repeated. &#x2018;I trust my people have looked after you er all of you?' His lazy glance swept the room. &#x2018;Dear me!' he said. &#x2018;George, you are near to it: oblige me, my dear fellow, by pulling the bell!'</p> <p>&#x2018;We do not need any refreshment, I thank you, Richard,' said Louisa.</p> <p>The faint, sweet smile silenced her as none of her husband's expostulations had ever done. &#x2018;My dear Louisa, you mistake I assure you, you mistake! George is in the most urgent need of er stimulant. Yes, Jeffries, I rang. The Madeira oh, ah! and some ratafia, Jeffries, if you please!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Richard, that's the best Waterfall I've ever seen!' exclaimed George, his admiring gaze fixed on the intricate arrangement of the Corinthian's cravat.</p> <p>&#x2018;You flatter me, George; I fear you flatter me.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Pshaw!' snapped Louisa.</p> <p>&#x2018;Precisely, my dear Louisa,' agreed Sir Richard amiably. </p> <p>&#x2018;Do not try to provoke me, Richard!' said Louisa, on a warning note. &#x2018;I will allow your appearance to be everything that it should be admirable, I am sure!'</p> <p>&#x2018;One does one's poor best,' murmured Sir Richard.</p> <p>Her bosom swelled. &#x2018;Richard, I could hit you!' she declared.</p> <p>The smile grew, allowing her a glimpse of excellent white teeth. &#x2018;I don't think you could, my dear.'</p> <p>George so far forgot himself as to laugh. A quelling glance was directed upon him. &#x2018;George, be quiet!' said Louisa.</p> <p>&#x2018;I must say,' conceded Lady Wyndham, whose maternal pride could not quite be overborne, &#x2018;there is no one, except Mr Brummell, of course, who looks as well as you do, Richard.'</p> <p>He bowed, but he did not seem to be unduly elated by this encomium. Possibly he took it as his due. He was a very notable Corinthian. From his Wind-swept hair (most difficult of all styles to achieve), to the toes of his gleaming Hessians, he might have posed as an advertisement for the Man of Fashion. His fine shoulders set off a coat of superfine cloth to perfection; his cravat, which had excited George's admiration, had been arranged by the hands of a master; his waistcoat was chosen with a nice eye; his biscuit-coloured pantaloons showed not one crease; and his Hessians with their jaunty gold tassels, had not only been made for him by Hoby, but were polished, George suspected, with a blacking mixed with champagne. A quizzing-glass on a black ribbon hung round his neck; a fob at his waist; and in one hand he carried a S�vres snuff-box. His air proclaimed his unutterable boredom, but no tailoring, no amount of studied nonchalance, could conceal the muscle in his thighs, or the strength of his shoulders. Above the starched points of his shirt-collar, a weary, handsome face showed its owner's disillusionment. Heavy lids drooped over grey eyes which were intelligent enough, but only to observe the vanities of the world; the smile which just touched that resolute mouth seem...</p></p><h2>Claire Shaeffer&#39;s Fabric Sewing Guide (Creative Machine Arts)</h2><p><p>Eliminates the need to search through multiple sewing guides for answers.</p><p>Thoroughly updated, with the addition of 225 color photos and a fabric and fiber dictionary.</p><p><i>Claire Shaeffer's Fabric Sewing Guide</i> is your one-stop sewing resource, with answers to the most common sewing questions and details about the latest advancements in sewing.

The only certainty was that she was being held captive, and special agent Grant Sullivan was the man to rescue her. Finding her was easy; getting her out was something else. But in the time they spent together, questions of guilt and innocence began to fade against the undeniable attraction between this fiery couple....<br><br><em>Diamond Bay</em><br><br>Rachel Jones wasn't looking for trouble, much less a man, but then she found Kell Sabin. He was washed up on her beach, barely alive. Someone had shot him twice. Her sixth sense told her that she was his only hope. With him lying unconscious before her, Rachel had to decide his future, as well as her own.<br><br></p><p>Linda Howard is the award-winning author of many <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, including <em>Up Close and Dangerous, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Cover of Night, Killing Time, To Die For, Kiss Me While I Sleep, Cry No More, </em>and <em>Dying to Please.</em> She lives in Alabama with her husband and two golden retrievers.<br><br>He was getting too old for this kind of crap, Grant Sullivan thought irritably. What the hell was he doing crouched here, when he'd promised himself he'd never set foot in a jungle again? He was supposed to rescue a bubble-brained society deb, but from what he'd seen in the two days he'd had this jungle fortress under surveillance, he thought she might not <em>want </em>to be rescued. She looked as if she was having the time of her life: laughing, flirting, lying by the pool in the heat of the day. She slept late; she drank champagne on the flagstone patio. Her father was almost out of his mind with worry about her, thinking that she was suffering unspeakable torture at the hands of her captors. Instead, she was lolling around as if she were vacationing on the Riviera. She certainly wasn't being tortured. If anyone was being tortured, Grant thought with growing ire, it was he himself. Mosquitoes were biting him, flies were stinging him, sweat was running off him in rivers, and his legs were aching from sitting still for so long. He'd been eating field rations again, and he'd forgotten how much he hated field rations. The humidity made all of his old wounds ache, and he had plenty of old wounds to ache. No doubt about it: he was definitely too old.<br><br>He was thirty-eight, and he'd spent over half his life involved in some war, somewhere. He was tired, tired enough that he'd opted out the year before, wanting nothing more than to wake up in the same bed every morning. He hadn't wanted company or advice or anything, except to be left the hell alone. When he had burned out, he'd burned to the core.<br><br>He hadn't quite retreated to the mountains to live in a cave, where he wouldn't have to see or speak to another human being, but he had definitely considered it. Instead, he'd bought a run-down farm in Tennessee, just in the shadow of the mountains, and let the green mists heal him. He'd dropped out, but apparently he hadn't dropped far enough: they had still known how to find him. He supposed wearily that his reputation made it necessary for certain people to know his whereabouts at all times. Whenever a job called for jungle experience and expertise, they called for Grant Sullivan.<br><br>A movement on the patio caught his attention, and he cautiously moved a broad leaf a fraction of an inch to clear his line of vision. There she was, dressed to the nines in a frothy sundress and heels, with an enormous pair of sunglasses shading her eyes. She carried a book and a tall glass of something that looked deliciously cool; she arranged herself artfully on one of the poolside deck chairs, and prepared to wile away the muggy afternoon. She waved to the guards who patrolled the plantation grounds and flashed them her dimpled smile.<br><br>Damn her pretty, useless little hide! Why couldn't she have stayed under Daddy's wing, instead of sashaying around the world to prove how "independent" she was? All she'd proved was that she had a remarkable talent for landing herself in hot water.<br><br>Poor dumb little twit, he thought. She probably didn't even realize that she was one of the central characters in a nasty little espionage caper that had at least three government and several other factions, all hostile, scrambling to find a missing microfilm. The only thing that had saved her life so far was that no one was sure how much she knew, or whether she knew anything at all. Had she been involved in George Persall's espionage activities, he wondered, or had she only been his mistress, his high-class "secretary"? Did she know where the microfilm was, or did Luis Marcel, who had disappeared, have it? The only thing anyone knew for certain was that George Persall had had the microfilm in his possession. But he'd died of a heart attack&#x2014;in <em>her </em>bedroom&#x2014;and the microfilm hadn't been found. Had Persall already passed it to Luis Marcel? Marcel had dropped out of sight two days before Persall died&#x2014;if he had the microfilm, he certainly wasn't talking about it. The Americans wanted it, the Russians wanted it, the Sandinistas wanted it, and every rebel group in Central and South America wanted it. Hell, Sullivan thought, as far as he knew, even the Eskimos wanted it.<br><br>So where was the microfilm? What had George Persall done with it? If he had indeed passed it to Luis Marcel, who was his normal contact, then where was Luis? Had Luis decided to sell the microfilm to the highest bidder? That seemed unlikely. Grant knew Luis personally; they had been in some tight spots together and he trusted Luis at his back, which said a lot.<br><br>Government agents had been chasing this particular microfilm for about a month now. A high-level executive of a research firm in California had made a deal to sell the government-classified laser technology his firm had developed, technology that could place laser weaponry in space in the near future. The firm's own security people had become suspicious of the man and alerted the proper government authorities; together they had apprehended the executive in the middle of the sale. But the two buyers had escaped, taking the microfilm with them. Then one of the buyers double-crossed his partner and took himself and the microfilm to South America to strike his own deal. Agents all over Central and South America had been alerted, and an American agent in Costa Rica had made contact with the man, setting up a "sting" to buy the microfilm. Things became completely confused at that point. The deal had gone sour, and the agent had been wounded, but he had gotten away with the microfilm. The film should have been destroyed at that point, but it hadn't been. Somehow the agent had gotten it to George Persall, who could come and go freely in Costa Rica because of his business connections. Who would have suspected George Persall of being involved in espionage? He'd always seemed just a tame businessman, albeit with a passion for gorgeous "secretaries"&#x2014;a weakness any Latin man would understand. Persall had been known to only a few agents, Luis Marcel among them, and that had made him extraordinarily effective. But in this case, George had been left in the dark; the agent had been feverish from his wound and hadn't told George to destroy the film.<br><br>Luis Marcel had been supposed to contact George, but instead Luis had disappeared. Then George, who had always seemed to be disgustingly healthy, had died of a heart attack...and no one knew where the microfilm was. The Americans wanted to be certain that the technology didn't fall into anyone else's hands; the Russians wanted the technology just as badly, and every revolutionary in the hemisphere wanted the microfilm in order to sell it to the highest bidder. An arsenal of weapons could be purchased, revolutions could be staged, with the amount of money that small piece of film would bring on the open market.<br><br>Manuel Turego, head of national security in Costa Rica, was a very smart man; he was a bastard, Grant thought, but a smart one. He'd promptly snatched up Ms. Priscilla Jane Hamilton Greer and carried her off to this heavily guarded inland "plantation." He'd probably told her that she was under protective custody, and she was probably stupid enough that she was very grateful to him for "protecting" her. Turego had played it cool; so far he hadn't harmed her. Evidently he knew that her father was a very wealthy, very influential man, and that it wasn't wise to enrage wealthy, influential men unless it was absolutely necessary. Turego was playing a waiting game; he was waiting for Luis Marcel to surface, waiting for the microfilm to surface, as it eventually had to. In the meantime, he had Priscilla; he could afford to wait. Whether she knew anything or not, she was valuable to him as a negotiating tool, if nothing else.<br><br>From the moment Priscilla had disappeared, her father had been frantic. He'd been calling in political favors with a heavy hand, but he'd found that none of the favors owed to him could get Priscilla away from Turego. Until Luis was found, the American government wasn't going to lift a hand to free the young woman. The confusion about whether or not she actually knew anything, the tantalizing possibility that she <em>could </em>know the location of the microfilm, seemed to have blunted the intensity of the search for Luis. Her captivity could give him the edge he needed by attracting attention away from him.<br><br>Finally, desperate with worry and enraged by the lack of response he'd been getting from the government, James Hamilton had decided to take matters into his own hands. He'd spent a small fortune ferreting out his daughter's location, and then had been stymied by the inaccessibility of the well-guarded plantation. If he sent in enough men to take over the plantation, he realized, there was a strong possibility that his daughter would be killed in the fight. Then someone had mentioned Grant Sullivan's name.<br><br>A man as wealthy as James Hamilton could find someone who didn't want to be found, even a wary, burnt-out ex-government agent who had buried himself in the Tennessee mountains. Within twenty-four hours, Grant had been sitting across from Hamilton, in the library of a huge estate house that shouted of old money. Hamilton had made an offer that would pay off the mortgage on Grant's farm completely. All the man wanted was to have his daughter back, safe and sound. His face had been lined and taut with worry, and there had been a desperation about him that, even more than the money, made Grant reluctantly accept the job.<br><br>The difficulty of rescuing her had seemed enormous, perhaps even insurmountable; if he were able to penetrate the security of the plantation&#x2014;something he didn't really doubt&#x2014;getting her out would be something else entirely. Not only that, but Grant had his own personal experiences to remind him that, even if he found her, the odds were greatly against her being alive or recognizably human. He hadn't let himself think about what could have happened to her since the day she'd been kidnapped.<br><br>But getting to her had been made ridiculously easy; as soon as he left Hamilton's house, a new wrinkle had developed. Not a mile down the highway from Hamilton's estate, he'd glanced in the rearview mirror and found a plain blue sedan on his tail. He'd lifted one eyebrow sardonically and pulled over to the shoulder of the road.<br><br>He lit a cigarette and inhaled leisurely as he waited for the two men to approach his car. "Hiya, Curtis."<br><br>Ted Curtis leaned down and peered in the open window, grinning. "Guess who wants to see you?"<br><br>"Hell," Grant swore irritably. "All right, lead the way. I don't have to drive all the way to Virginia, do I?"<br><br>"Naw, just to the next town. He's waiting in a motel."<br><br>The fact that Sabin had felt it necessary to leave headquarters at all told Grant a lot. He knew Kell Sabin from the old days; the man didn't have a nerve in his body, and ice water ran in his veins. He wasn't a comfortable man to be around, but Grant knew that the same had been said about himself. They were both men to whom no rules applied, men who had intimate knowledge of hell, who had lived and hunted in that gray jungle where no laws existed. The difference between them was that Sabin was comfortable in that cold grayness; it was his life&#x2014;but Grant wanted no more of it. Things had gone too far; he had felt himself becoming less than human. He had begun to lose his sense of who he was and why he was there. Nothing seemed to matter any longer. The only time he'd felt alive was during the chase, when adrenaline pumped through his veins and fired all his senses into acute awareness. The bullet that had almost killed him had instead saved him, because it had stopped him long enough to let him begin thinking again. That was when he'd decided to get out.<br><br>Twenty-five minutes later, with his hand curled around a mug of strong, hot coffee, his booted feet propped comfortably on the genuine, wood-grained plastic coffee table that was standard issue for motels, Grant had murmured, "Well, I'm here. Talk."<br><br>Kell Sabin was an even six feet tall, an inch shorter than Grant, and the hard musculature of his frame revealed that he made it a point to stay in shape, even though he was no longer in the field. He was dark&#x2014;black-haired, black-eyed, with an olive complexion&#x2014;and the cold fire of his energy generated a force field around him. He was impossible to read, and was as canny as a stalking panther, but Grant trusted him. He couldn't say that he liked Sabin; Sabin wasn't a man to be friendly. Yet for twenty years their lives had been intertwined until they were virtually a part of each other. In his mind, Grant saw a red-orange flash of gunfire, and abruptly he felt the thick, moist heat of the jungle, smelled the rotting vegetation, saw the flash of weapons being discharged.and felt, at his back, so close that each had braced his shoulders against the other, the same man who sat across from him now. Things like that stayed in a man's memory.<br><br>A dangerous man, Kell Sabin. Hostile governments would gladly have paid a fortune to get to him, but Sabin was nothing more than a shadow slipping away from the sunshine, as he directed his troops from the gray mists.<br><br>Without a flicker of expression in his black eyes, Sabin studied the man who sat across from him in a lazy sprawl&#x2014; a deceptively lazy sprawl, he knew. Grant was, if anything, even leaner and harder than he had been in the field. Hibernating for a year hadn't made him go soft. There was still something wild about Grant Sullivan, something dangerous and untamed. It was in the wary, restless glitter of his amber eyes, eyes that glowed as fierce and golden as an eagle's under the dark, level brows. His dark blond hair was shaggy, curling down over his collar in back, emphasizing that he wasn't quite civilized. He was darkly tanned; the small scar on his chin wasn't very noticeable, but the thin line that slashed across his left cheekbone was silver against his bronzed skin. They weren't disfiguring scars, but reminders of battles.<br><br></p><h2>Jerusalem&#39;s Hope (Zion Legacy, Book 6)</h2><p>Taking refuge beneath the Temple Mount during the 1948 war of independence, Israeli strategist Moshe Sachar opens another of the temple&#39;s ancient scrolls and reads about the first-century miracles of Yeshua, a Roman centurion&#39;s choice between love and duty, and three orphan messengers to a Bethlehem shepherd. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>Bodie and Brock Thoene are the authors of <i>Jerusalem Vigil</i>, <i>Thunder from Jerusalem</i>, <i>Jerusalem's Heart</i>, <i>The Jerusalem Scrolls</i>, and <i>Stones of Jerusalem</i>-the first five volumes of the Zion Legacy series. Their other thirty-two novels include the bestselling series The Zion Chronicles and the Zion Covenant series. Together they have won eight Evangelical Christian Publishers Gold Medallion awards.The Thoenes conclude their epic "Zion Legacy" series with another story-in-a-story, much like the previous The Jerusalem Scrolls and Stones of Jerusalem. Moshe Sachar is hidden beneath the Temple Mount during Israel's 1948 war of independence. When he opens another of the temple's ancient scrolls, the action shifts to first century CE. Word is spreading of the miracles performed by a mysterious prophet named Yeshua. The unlikely people Yeshua has touched--a Roman centurion, three orphan boys, and a rabbi from the high council--are all conflicted, wondering whether Yeshua is the Messiah. Only the head shepherd in Bethlehem is confident of Yeshua's true identity. As Passover approaches, an unruly mob in Jerusalem provokes Pontius Pilate to violence against them, and rumor spreads that Yeshua will spend the holiday there. Unfortunately, the novel never returns to the framing story set in 1948, so readers have no idea what happens to Moshe and his family. How satisfied readers will be with the inconclusive ending is debatable, but all libraries will want to complete the series. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hollowpox: The Hunt for Morrigan Crow Book 3 (Nevermoor)</h2><p><p>Morrigan Crow and her friends have survived their first year as proud scholars of the elite Wundrous Society, helped bring down the nefarious Ghastly Market, and proven themselves loyal to Unit 919.

Yet, hateful as these depictions were, the story they tell is not as simple as it first appears.</p><p>Drawing on a wide range of primary sources, Lipton argues that these visual stereotypes were neither an inevitable outgrowth of Christian theology nor a simple reflection of medieval prejudices. Instead, she maps out the complex relationship between medieval Christians' religious ideas, social experience, and developing artistic practices that drove their depiction of Jews from benign, if exoticized, figures connoting ancient wisdom to increasingly vicious portrayals inspired by (and designed to provoke) fear and hostility.</p><p>At the heart of this lushly illustrated and meticulously researched work are questions that have occupied scholars for ages&#x2015;why did Jews becomes such powerful and poisonous symbols in medieval art? Why were Jews associated with certain objects, symbols, actions, and deficiencies? And what were the effects of such portrayals&#x2015;not only in medieval society, but throughout Western history? What we find is that the image of the Jew in medieval art was not a portrait of actual neighbors or even imagined others, but a cloudy glass into which Christendom gazed to find a distorted, phantasmagoric rendering of itself.</p></p><p><b>Sara Lipton</b> is an Associate Professor of History at SUNY Stony Brook and the author of <i>Images of Intolerance: The Representation of Jews and Judaism in the Bible moralis�e</i>, which won the Medieval Academy of America's John Nicholas Brown prize.

The fruit of this medieval spring included the rebirth of a great empire (the now-Holy Roman Empire), the revival of large-scale stone building and a related explosion of artistic creativity, and the emergence of new devotional foci and more vision- and art-oriented modes of worship.2 These same years also saw the appearance of an entirely new figure in Christian art: the visually recognizable Jew. The simultaneous emergence of these historical and artistic changes is not coincidental. They are, rather, intimately related: the birth of new and increasingly image-based Christian practices led to the visual articulation of previously unillustrated abstract ideas about Jews. As Christians learned to give visible form to a range of themes associated with &#x201c;that which is Christian,&#x201d; they likewise began visually to mark &#x201c;that which is not.&#x201d;</p> <p>1. A Jewish Hat?</p> <p>When Christian artists finally began to single out Jews, they did so, somewhat anticlimactically, with a hat. As any handbook of medieval iconography will attest, and as any glance at an illuminated manuscript or stained glass window from the later twelfth or thirteenth century makes clear, Jews can be recognized in high medieval art by various versions of the pointed or peaked headgear known sometimes as the <i>pileum cornutum</i> (horned cap) or simply as the &#x201c;Jewish hat.&#x201d;3 This hat first appeared on the heads of painted Jews in the eleventh century and by about 1150 had become the sign par excellence of the Jew.4 [Fig. 1] What is less clear is <i>why</i> this came about. Why, after so many centuries of benign neglect, did artists suddenly begin to mark Jews in this way? Did Jews of the period change their dress, or did artists for some reason start paying novel attention to Jews&#x2019; clothing? Or was the <i>pileum</i> a purely artistic invention, an arbitrary identifying sign unrelated to actual practice? For that matter, why did Jews need to be identified at all? And most importantly, what did &#x201c;Jewishness&#x201d; mean when expressed through this symbol?</p> <p>The issue may not immediately seem momentous. There is, after all, nothing remarkable about using a hat as an identifying mark. In a period when portraiture was not practiced and when most people were classified according to rank, office, or function, clothing&#x2014;particularly headgear&#x2014;was the single most common means by which figures were distinguished in art. Popes were depicted with tiaras, kings with crowns, soldiers with helmets: objects that, if not worn every day, nevertheless constituted essential and conspicuous elements of their &#x201c;professional&#x201d; attire.5 Why should we not see the &#x201c;Jewish hat&#x201d; as a straightforward corollary, a faithful representation of the garb adopted by the people of the Mosaic law in accordance with that law?6</p> <p>One basic reason for looking more deeply into the sign is its sheer newness. Medieval artists tended to work from models and to replicate venerable traditions, none of which, before 1000, depicted Jews with hats. This is not to say that change never happened&#x2014;indeed, the period we shall be examining was a time of markedly creative artistic change&#x2014;but it does mean that each change represents a deliberate and potentially meaningful choice, which should be examined and understood. Moreover, even &#x201c;straightforward&#x201d; identifying marks still embody a point of view, convey a certain meaning. A king wasn&#x2019;t painted wearing his crown simply because kings wore crowns&#x2014;kings also wore gloves on cold days and hats or hoods in rainy weather, but we are rarely treated to pictures of them doing so. Rather, kings wore crowns on ritual occasions because they symbolized power and sovereignty, and images of crowned kings capture and fix those attributes.</p> <p>The &#x201c;Jewish hat&#x201d; is just as ideological, and considerably more complicated, a sign. The first complication is that it is by no means certain that in the period and place where the iconography was developed&#x2014;eleventh-century northwestern Europe&#x2014;Jewish men regularly wore hats at all or regarded covering the head as a religious obligation. It is important at this point to consider the nature of early medieval Jewish life. There is a widespread tendency (evident especially though not exclusively in Hollywood productions) to picture medieval Franco-German Jewish communities as purer versions of the Polish shtetl or the ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods of Brooklyn, teeming with black-hatted, heavy-coated scholars devoted night and day to intense study of the Talmud, splendidly isolated from and oblivious to the outside Christian world. This is a seriously inaccurate impression.7 Like their forebears, eleventh-century Jews strove daily to maintain their religious traditions and to observe Jewish law, but living in the Latin West posed unique challenges.8 Most Jewish communities in eleventh-century northern Europe were small and quite scattered. While one or two of the largest may have numbered as many as a thousand souls, the average size of a Jewish community was probably closer to one hundred, with the smallest consisting of just a handful of individuals.9 Some Jews were the only members of their faith in their village. Many communities worshipped in private houses, as they could not afford (or felt no need for) a separate synagogue building, and no community boasted a full-time rabbi or religious teacher.10 The great Jewish scholars of the period supplemented their incomes by working as merchants, vintners, or craftsmen; other Jews worked the land or possessed land worked by Christian peasants.11 Scholars of any kind were a minority; the average Jewish male adult was supposed to know some Hebrew, but actual command of the language varied widely, and we have several texts attesting that some Jewish men knew no Hebrew at all.12 Under such conditions Jews were of necessity economically and to a certain extent culturally and socially integrated into their Christian surroundings: they lived on the same streets and sometimes in the same buildings as Christians; they bought food and goods from, and sold them to, Christians; they entertained Christians at their tables and employed them in their homes; they attended Christian trade fairs, went on outings with Christian nobles, and (when it suited them) aired their grievances in Christian courts.13 Jewish mothers suckled their Gentile neighbors&#x2019; babies when their own failed fully to drain their breasts, and they called on the same pagan goddess to protect their children as did their Christian counterparts.14 The fact that, according to Rabbi Samson ben Abraham of Sens (d. ca. 1230), it was customary for young Jewish men to celebrate a friend&#x2019;s wedding by conducting a rowdy joust on horseback shows vividly enough that even as late as the thirteenth century, when various restrictions had begun to socially distance Jews from Christians, we are dealing with a culture far from the shtetls of Poland.15</p> <p>How did such communities approach the issue of covering the head? Jewish law and tradition are far less clear on the question than might be thought. The Hebrew scriptures say nothing about prescribed headgear for anyone other than the high priest and his sons, whose head coverings signified their priestly status.16 Although the Talmud praises men for covering their heads, especially during prayer, apparently even in Babylonian academic centers only married scholars of consequence habitually did so; in Palestine even pious scholars seem not to have covered their heads.17 If such vagueness and diversity of opinion prevailed among the Talmudic sages, one would hardly expect greater clarity or rigor from medieval authorities. And indeed, there was no consensus about the subject among medieval rabbis. In fact, they rarely discussed it&#x2014;a strong signal that no great significance was invested in head coverings and also that no sharp change in practice was taking place. Most scholars apparently followed the Palestinian approach in <i>not</i> requiring that the head be covered during blessings, prayer, or study, much less during the course of daily business.18 Abraham ben Nathan of Lunel, a well-regarded rabbi from late-twelfth-century France, recorded that he prayed bareheaded, and there is no reason to think that this was a daring departure or that he was alone.19 Starting around the mid-thirteenth century, the wearing of hats did become more common among Jewish men (for reasons explored in chapter 4), but it was not until well after the end of the Middle Ages that covering the head both inside and outside the synagogue became standard practice for religious Jews.20</p> <p>Finally, there is little reason to think that those eleventh-century Jews who did cover their heads&#x2014;and some surely must have, whether out of piety, dignity, or simply to ward off the cold&#x2014;would have sported pointed or otherwise distinctively &#x201c;Jewish&#x201d; hats. At various points in history Jews did seem to wear headgear not unlike the <i>pileum cornutum</i>: they are portrayed wearing pointed hats in Assyrian reliefs of the ninth century BCE (as are many other peoples) and probably wore the peaked Persian felt cap during their subjection to Persian rule.21 But they did so because Jews generally conformed outwardly to the society in which they lived; it would strain credulity to assume that such ancient garb was worn in an unbroken tradition during the intervening millennium and a half, in lands far from Persian dominions, and leaving no further trace in the visual or textual record. The unchanging nature of Jewish customs and observances is a common trope, positively asserted by many Jews and negatively by many non-Jews, but it is a completely unhistorical one. Talmudic discussions of head coverings mention not hats or caps but the <i>sudra,</i> a wrapped kerchief or turban common in Babylon, while Greek and Roman texts indicate that Hellenized Jews wore no distinctive costume.22 Jews in Muslim lands wore turbans identical to those of their Muslim neighbors.23</p> <p>The few surviving early medieval references to Jewish clothing likewise suggest that Jews dressed no differently from their Gentile neighbors. The only aspect of their attire that attracted comment was the luxury displayed by wealthier Jews. Bishop Agobard of Lyons (d. 840), a notably dyspeptic cleric who bitterly resented the favor shown Jews by Carolingian rulers, complained about the ostentation of Jewish women&#x2019;s dresses; to the bishop&#x2019;s disgust, these dresses were gifts from the emperor&#x2019;s female relatives and other palace noblewomen, and they presumably reflected the latest court fashions.24 Another ninth-century text, a biography of Pope Gregory the Great by John the Deacon, associates Jews with a certain kind of hat, but one made of fur, and it does so in the context of scolding a Christian bishop for wearing a fur hat in preference to more customary clerical headgear.25 In the tenth and eleventh centuries Jewish merchants are known to have traded in luxurious garments and textiles, including furs, gold-brocaded cloth, and silks, some of which were imported from Muslim lands; though the merchants and their families may well have worn such exotic clothing themselves, this would not have made them stand out in elite circles, as most of their customers were Christian noblemen and women.26 Contemporary descriptions of the Christian cleric Bodo, who converted to Judaism in the ninth century, note that upon his conversion he &#x201c;allowed his hair and beard to grow long&#x201d; and started to wear a sword but say nothing about covering his head, much less adopting any special kind of hat.27 In fact, the thrust of all accounts of Bodo&#x2019;s conversion is to highlight not so much those changes that made him look <i>more</i> like a <i>Jew</i> but those that made him look <i>less</i> like a <i>cleric.</i> Conversely, when a certain (unnamed) Jew converted to Christianity in the early eleventh century, we are told that because he became a priest he shaved off his beard and &#x201c;affected baldness on his head&#x201d; (that is, adopted the clerical tonsure), but nothing is said of his abandoning any &#x201c;Jewish&#x201d; headgear.28 The famous French rabbi Rashi (d. 1105) mentions in passing that when a person is warm he takes off his <i>kumta</i> (cap) or <i>sudra</i> (turban), but, again, nothing in the comment suggests that these were widespread, peculiarly Jewish, or religiously meaningful fashion items.29 The earliest Jewish textual reference to Jewish headgear cited in the major modern study of Jewish costume dates to 1295; the earliest Christian reference is a 1267 ordinance from Breslau.30</p> <p>In sum, we have no reason to think that in eleventh-century Europe the wearing of hats by Jews was either a new or a (newly noted) general custom, that covering the head was considered a central element of Jewish observance, or that those Jews who did wear hats wore characteristic or conspicuously pointed ones. The only evidence we really have for the wearing of pointed &#x201c;Jewish hats&#x201d; by medieval Jews prior to the thirteenth century is art.31 And it hardly seems satisfactory to answer the question posed by our images by citing the very images we are trying to explain.</p> <p>2. The Sign of the Hat</p> <p>If it has proven fruitless to look to actual sartorial practice to explain the emergence of the &#x201c;Jewish hat&#x201d; in eleventh-century art, this should not come as a surprise. Medieval images served many purposes: they glorified God, embodied sanctity, told tales, radiated authority, and inspired miracles, but they did not seek to document their surroundings.32 Even when images did reflect reality, it was because that particular reality was invested with special meaning, and its representation therefore expressed important religious or political ideas. And so we have come back to the questions I posed at the outset: Why did an identifying sign for Jews suddenly become necessary at the dawn of the high Middle Ages? And what was the sign of the pointed &#x201c;Jewish hat&#x201d; trying to say?33</p> <p>For some time scholars believed they had an answer. In <i>A History of Jewish Costume</i>, Alfred Rubens claims that the very first appearance of the pointed &#x201c;Jewish hat&#x201d; in art was in the painted initials of the Stavelot Bible, a giant two-volume illustrated Bible made for the Abbey of Stavelot in the region known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine (now Belgium).34 [Fig. 2] This Bible is conveniently signed by its scribe, a rather charming monk called Goderanus, who is humble about his virtues but tangibly (and justifiably) proud of his handiwork. At the end of the Bible Goderanus tells us not only his name and his hopes and dreams for himself and his brother monks but also the year of the manuscript&#x2019;s completion: &#x201c;I, Goderanus, a sinner, and Brother Ernesto, my helper and comrade in that labor, commit this and a companion volume to the Abbey of Stavelot.&#x2026; We have written both these volumes constantly and most diligently for almost four years.&#x2026; And it is now the 1097th year of the Incarnation of the Lord&nbsp;&#x2026; in the Fifth Indiction, with Emperor Henry IV ruling and as an army of Christians is violently driving against the pagans.&#x201d;35 What a perfect context for the birth of anti-Jewish iconography: the Bible was made during the First Crusade in the very heartland of Godfrey of Bouillon, Duke of Lower Lorraine, first Latin...</p></p><h2>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</h2><p><b>Now a major motion picture from HBO� starring Oprah Winfrey and Rose Byrne.<br></b><br>Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells&#x2014;taken without her knowledge&#x2014;became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first &#x201c;immortal&#x201d; human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they&#x2019;d weigh more than 50 million metric tons&#x2014;as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb&#x2019;s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. <br><br>Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.<br><br>Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the &#x201c;colored&#x201d; ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta&#x2019;s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia&#x2014;a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo&#x2014;to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells. <br><br>Henrietta&#x2019;s family did not learn of her &#x201c;immortality&#x201d; until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family&#x2014;past and present&#x2014;is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. <br><br>Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family&#x2014;especially Henrietta&#x2019;s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother&#x2019;s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn&#x2019;t her children afford health insurance?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i> captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, February 2010</strong>: From a single, abbreviated life grew a seemingly immortal line of cells that made some of the most crucial innovations in modern science possible. And from that same life, and those cells, Rebecca Skloot has fashioned in <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> a fascinating and moving story of medicine and family, of how life is sustained in laboratories and in memory. Henrietta Lacks was a mother of five in Baltimore, a poor African American migrant from the tobacco farms of Virginia, who died from a cruelly aggressive cancer at the age of 30 in 1951. A sample of her cancerous tissue, taken without her knowledge or consent, as was the custom then, turned out to provide one of the holy grails of mid-century biology: human cells that could survive--even thrive--in the lab. Known as HeLa cells, their stunning potency gave scientists a building block for countless breakthroughs, beginning with the cure for polio. Meanwhile, Henrietta's family continued to live in poverty and frequently poor health, and their discovery decades later of her unknowing contribution--and her cells' strange survival--left them full of pride, anger, and suspicion. For a decade, Skloot doggedly but compassionately gathered the threads of these stories, slowly gaining the trust of the family while helping them learn the truth about Henrietta, and with their aid she tells a rich and haunting story that asks the questions, Who owns our bodies? And who carries our memories? --<em>Tom Nissley<br><br></em> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Jad Abumrad Reviews <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong>Jad Abumrad is host and creator of the public radio hit <em>Radiolab</em>, now in its seventh season and reaching over a million people monthly. <em>Radiolab</em> combines cutting-edge production with a philosophical approach to big ideas in science and beyond, and an inventive method of storytelling.

Read his exclusive Amazon guest review of <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em>:</strong> <br> <p></p> <p>Honestly, I can't imagine a better tale.</p> <p>A detective story that's at once mythically large and painfully intimate.</p> <p>Just the simple facts are hard to believe: that in 1951, a poor black woman named Henrietta Lacks dies of cervical cancer, but pieces of the tumor that killed her--taken without her knowledge or consent--live on, first in one lab, then in hundreds, then thousands, then in giant factories churning out polio vaccines, then aboard rocket ships launched into space. The cells from this one tumor would spawn a multi-billion dollar industry and become a foundation of modern science--leading to breakthroughs in gene mapping, cloning and fertility and helping to discover how viruses work and how cancer develops (among a million other things). All of which is to say: the science end of this story is enough to blow one's mind right out of one's face.</p> <p>But what's truly remarkable about Rebecca Skloot's book is that we also get the rest of the story, the part that could have easily remained hidden had she not spent ten years unearthing it: Who was Henrietta Lacks? How did she live? How she did die? Did her family know that she'd become, in some sense, immortal, and how did that affect them? These are crucial questions, because science should never forget the people who gave it life. And so, what unfolds is not only a reporting tour de force but also a very entertaining account of Henrietta, her ancestors, her cells and the scientists who grew them.</p> <p>The book ultimately channels its journey of discovery though Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah, who never knew her mother, and who dreamt of one day being a scientist.</p> <p>As Deborah Lacks and Skloot search for answers, we're bounced effortlessly from the tiny tobacco-farming Virginia hamlet of Henrietta's childhood to modern-day Baltimore, where Henrietta's family remains. Along the way, a series of unforgettable juxtapositions: cell culturing bumps into faith healings, cutting edge medicine collides with the dark truth that Henrietta's family can't afford the health insurance to care for diseases their mother's cells have helped to cure.</p> <p>Rebecca Skloot tells the story with great sensitivity, urgency and, in the end, damn fine writing.

It concerns the murder of strong- willed Prudence Barrymore, a gifted nurse of good family, with heroic service in the Crimean War behind her. Working now in London's Royal Free Hospital, mostly with prominent surgeon Sir Herbert Stanhope, she is found, strangled, in a hospital laundry chute. Monk is hired by Lady Callandra Daviot, on the hospital's board of governors, to try to find the killer. He enlists the help of old friend Hester Latterly, another dedicated nurse, who takes a job in the hospital, hoping to ferret out useful information. Her efforts are largely unproductive, and matters seem hopeless until evidence comes to light that puts Sir Herbert on trial for the murder. A series of courtroom scenes full of unexpected zigs and zags help redeem the many, many ponderous chapters that have gone before--weighed down with Monk's inner reveries, mini lectures on downtrodden Victorian woman, and lots of stately chitchat.

Faludi's reportorial and literary skills unfold with breathtaking confidence and beauty... She goes a long way toward eliminating the black and white, good and evil, male and female polarities that have riven the sexes in the past three decades..."</strong> <strong>&#x2013;<em>Time</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p><p>In 1991, internationally renowned feminist journalist Susan Faludi ignited a revival of the women&#x2019;s movement with her revelatory investigative reportage: <em>Backlash</em> was nothing less than a landmark, uncovering an &#x201c;undeclared war&#x201d; against women&#x2019;s equality in the media, advertising, Hollywood, the workplace, and government&#x2014;a war that is still being fought today.</p><p><em>Stiffed</em> may be even more essential than <em>Backlash </em>to understanding the cultural riptides that led to Trumpian America. Here, Faludi turns her attention to the so-called &#x201c;Angry Male&#x201d; politics plaguing the nation. Through deeply researched, nuanced, and empathetic character studies of distressed industrial workers, laid-off aerospace engineers, combat veterans, football fans, evangelical husbands, suburban and inner-city teenage boys, and Hollywood and porn actors, <em>Stiffed </em>goes beyond the easy explanations of male misbehavior&#x2014;that it&#x2019;s driven by chromosomes or hormones&#x2014;to lay bare the powerful social and economic forces that have shattered the postwar compact defining American manhood.&nbsp; Faludi&#x2019;s vivid storytelling illuminates the historic and traumatic paradigm shift from a &#x201c;utilitarian&#x201d; manliness, grounded in civic and communal service, to an &#x201c;ornamental&#x201d; masculinity shaped by entertainment, marketing, and performance values. </p><p>Read in the light of Trumpian politics and the #MeToo movement, Faludi&#x2019;s analysis speaks acutely to our present crisis, and to a foreboding future.&nbsp;<em>Stiffed</em>&nbsp;delivers a searing portrait of modern-day male America, and traces the provenance of a gender war that continues to rage, unabated.</p></p><p>Susan Faludi, author of the feminist bestseller <i>Backlash</i>, has done it again with an exhaustive report on the betrayals felt by working men throughout the United States. American men are angry and discontented, she argues in <i>Stiffed</i>, because their sense of what it is to be a man has been destroyed by everything from corporate downsizing and the shrinking military of the post cold war era to the increase in local sports teams leaving town. Whether she's interviewing the teenage male members of Southern California's infamous Spur Posse (who collected "points" for every female they had sex with), Cleveland football fans shaken by the departure of the Browns football team, militia movement activists, or Sylvester Stallone, Faludi seems stuck on the idea that American men today are man-boys, unable to completely grow up because they never received the nurturing they needed, and now constantly disappointed by life. Yet while many of the men Faludi interviews have real problems--bad luck and sad, troubled lives--somehow <i>Stiffed</i> still seems a bit whiny. Faludi's "travels through a postwar male realm" are a fascinating slice of male American life "under siege" at the end of the 20th century, even if she does finally leave us like the men she talked to--still wondering just what went wrong. <i>--Linda Killian</i><p>One of the most talked-about books of last year, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>Backlash</em> now explores the collapse of traditional masculinity that has left men feeling betrayed. With <em>Backlash</em> in 1991, Susan Faludi broke new ground when she put her finger directly on the problem bedeviling women, and the light of recognition dawned on millions of her readers: what's making women miserable isn't something they're doing to themselves in the name of independence. It's something our society is doing to women. The book was nothing less than a landmark. Now in <em>Stiffed,</em> the author turns her attention to the masculinity crisis plaguing our culture at the end of the '90s, an era of massive layoffs, "Angry White Male" politics, and Million Man marches. As much as the culture wants to proclaim that men are made miserable--or brutal or violent or irresponsible--by their inner nature and their hormones, Faludi finds that even in the world they supposedly own and run, men are at the mercy of cultural forces that disfigure their lives and destroy their chance at happiness. As traditional masculinity continues to collapse, the once-valued male attributes of craft, loyalty, and social utility are no longer honored, much less rewarded. Faludi's journey through the modern masculine landscape takes her into the lives of individual men whose accounts reveal the heart of the male dilemma. <em>Stiffed</em> brings us into the world of industrial workers, sports fans, combat veterans, evangelical husbands, militiamen, astronauts, and troubled "bad" boys--whose sense that they've lost their skills, jobs, civic roles, wives, teams, and a secure future is only one symptom of a larger and historic betrayal. </p></p><h2>John Adams: A Life</h2><p>John Ferling's masterful <i>John Adams: A Life</i> is the most comprehensive single-volume biography of the man who succeeded George Washington in the presidency and shepherded the fragile new nation through the most dangerous of times.

John is the author of numerous books, including <i>Epic, Waking the Dead, Wild at Heart, and Desire</i>, and coauthor of Captivating and The Sacred Romance. John lives in Colorado with his wife, Stasi, and their three sons, Samuel, Blaine, and Luke. He loves living in the Rocky Mountains so he can pursue his other passions, including fly-fishing, mountain climbing, and exploring the waters of the West in his canoe.For bestselling evangelical author Eldredge (<i>Wild at Heart</i>), Christians are meant to inherit the kind of intimacy that Adam and Eve had with God in the Garden of Eden, but the belief that God only speaks through the Bible hinders a Christian's ability to experience that intimacy. Drawing from a year's worth of journaling about his walk with God, Eldredge models how talking to God is as easy as checking daily to ask, What are you saying, Lord? Sometimes when Eldredge queries God, God's response confounds him. For example, when God responds repeatedly with two words, My love, it takes an accident and a personal epiphany for Eldredge to understand that God wants him to rebuild [his] personality based on [God's] love. Through everyday life lessons, personal anecdotes and a lot of scripture, Eldredge shows how Christians can get into direct conversation with God, encouraging readers to ask for answers about anything and everything.

MY FOREARMS are thickly bandaged, heavy as clubs. My thighs are wrapped tightly, too; white gauze peeks out from the shorts Nurse Ava pulled from the lost and found box behind the nurses&#x2019; station.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like an orphan, I came here with no clothes. Like an orphan, I was wrapped in a bedsheet and left on the lawn of Regions Hospital in the freezing sleet and snow, blood seeping through the flowered sheet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The security guard who found me was bathed in menthol cigarettes and the flat stink of machine coffee. There was a curly forest of white hair inside his nostrils.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said, &#x201c;Holy Mother of God, girl, what&#x2019;s been done to you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother didn&#x2019;t come to claim me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But: I remember the stars that night. They were like salt against the sky, like someone spilled the shaker against very dark cloth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That mattered to me, their accidental beauty. The last thing I thought I might see before I died on the cold, wet grass.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> THE GIRLS HERE, THEY TRY TO GET ME TO TALK. They want to know <i>What&#x2019;s your story, morning glory? Tell me your tale, snail. </i>I hear their stories every day in Group, at lunch, in Crafts, at breakfast, at dinner, on and on. These words that spill from them, black memories, they can&#x2019;t stop. Their stories are eating them alive, turning them inside out. They cannot stop talking.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cut all my words out. My heart was too full of them.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I ROOM WITH LOUISA. LOUISA IS OLDER AND HER HAIR IS like a red-and-gold noisy ocean down her back. There&#x2019;s so much of it, she can&#x2019;t even keep it in with braids or buns or scrunchies. Her hair smells like strawberries; she smells better than any girl I&#x2019;ve ever known. I could breathe her in forever.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; My first night here, when she lifted her blouse to change for bed, in the moment before that crazy hair fell over her body like a protective cape, I saw them, all of them, and I sucked my breath in hard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be scared, little one.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn&#x2019;t scared. I&#x2019;d just never seen a girl with skin like mine.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> EVERY MOMENT IS SPOKEN FOR. WE ARE UP AT SIX o&#x2019;clock. We are drinking lukewarm coffee or watered-down juice by six forty-five. We have thirty minutes to scrape cream cheese on cardboardy bagels, or shove pale eggs in our mouths, or swallow lumpy oatmeal. At seven fifteen we can shower in our rooms. There are no doors on our showers and I don&#x2019;t know what the bathroom mirrors are, but they&#x2019;re not glass, and your face looks cloudy and lost when you brush your teeth or comb your hair. If you want to shave your legs, a nurse or an orderly has to be present, but no one wants that, and so our legs are like hairy-boy legs. By eight-thirty we&#x2019;re in Group and that&#x2019;s when the stories spill, and the tears spill, and some girls yell and some girls groan, but I just sit, sit, and that awful older girl, Blue, with the bad teeth, every day, she says, <i>Will you talk today, Silent Sue? I&#x2019;d like to hear from Silent Sue today, wouldn&#x2019;t you, Casper?</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Casper tells her to knock it off. Casper tells us to breathe, to make accordions by spreading our arms way, way out, and then pushing in, in, in, and then pulling out, out, out, and don&#x2019;t we feel better when we just breathe? Meds come after Group, then Quiet, then lunch, then Crafts, then Individual, which is when you sit with your doctor and cry some more, and then at five o&#x2019;clock there&#x2019;s dinner, which is more not-hot food, and more Blue: <i>Do you like macaroni and cheese, Silent Sue? When you getting those bandages off, Sue? </i>And then Entertainment.<br> After Entertainment, there is Phone Call, and more crying.<br> And then it&#x2019;s nine p.m. and more meds and then it&#x2019;s bed. The girls piss and hiss about the schedule, the food, Group, the meds, everything, but I don&#x2019;t care. There&#x2019;s food, and a bed, and it&#x2019;s warm, and I am inside, and I am safe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is not Sue. <br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> JEN S. IS A NICKER: SHORT, TWIGLIKE SCARS RUN UP AND down her arms and legs. She wears shiny athletic shorts; she&#x2019;s taller than anyone, except Doc Dooley. She dribbles an invisible basketball up and down the beige hallway. She shoots at an invisible hoop. Francie is a human pincushion. She pokes her skin with knitting needles, sticks, pins, whatever she can find. She has angry eyes and she spits on the floor. Sasha is a fat girl full of water: she cries in Group, she cries at meals, she cries in her room. She&#x2019;ll never be drained. She&#x2019;s a plain cutter: faint red lines crosshatch her arms. She doesn&#x2019;t go deep. Isis is a burner. Scabby, circular mounds dot her arms. There was something in Group about rope and boy cousins and a basement but I shut myself off for that; I turned up my inside music. Blue is a fancy bird with her pain; she has a little bit of everything: bad daddy, meth teeth, cigarette burns, razor slashes. Linda/Katie/Cuddles wears grandma housedresses. Her slippers are stinky. There are too many of her to keep track of; her scars are all on the inside, along with her people. I don&#x2019;t know why she&#x2019;s with us, but she is. She smears mashed potato on her face at dinner. Sometimes she vomits for no reason. Even when she is completely still, you know there is a <i>lot </i>happening inside her body, and that it&#x2019;s not good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew people like her on the outside; I stay away from her.</p><h2>Tennessee Williams: Plays 1937-1955 (Library of America)</h2><p>Tennessee Williams's explosive, often violent, plays shattered conventional proprieties and transformed the American stage. They inspired some of the most famous productions and performances in theatrical and film history, and they continue to grip audiences all over the world. Now, in an authoritative two-volume edition, The Library of America collects the plays that define Williams's extraordinary range and achievement. This first volume begins with the stunning rediscovered plays of Williams's early career: <i>Spring Storm</i>, a tragedy of provincial longing that prefigures the mood and language of his later work, and <i>Not About Nightingales</i>, a stark prison drama, produced in 1998 to international acclaim, that resounds with the playwright's outraged idealism. With the autobiographical <i>The Glass Menagerie </i>in 1944, Williams attained what he later called "the catastrophe of success," a success made all the greater by <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>, his most famous play and one of the most influential works of modern American literature.<br><br>Forging an idiom that uniquely blended lyricism and brutality, a tragic sense of life and a genius for comic observation, he continued to revolutionize the American theater with a series of masterpieces: the poignant and melancholy <i>Summer and Smoke</i>, the light-hearted erotic comedy <i>The Rose Tattoo</i>, the sprawling and surrealistic <i>Camino Real,</i> and <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i>, the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning portrayal of a ruthless family struggle. This volume also contains <i>Battle of Angels</i> (an early version of <i>Orpheus Descending</i>), and a selection of Williams's one-act plays, including <i>27 Wagons Full of Cotton</i>, <i>The Property Is Condemned</i>, and <i>I Rise in Flame, Cried the Phoenix</i>, a meditation on the life and work of D. H. Lawrence.<br><br>This edition includes a newly researched chronology of Tennessee Williams's life, explanatory notes (including cast lists of many of the original productions), and an essay on the texts.</p><p>This volume is edited by Mel Gussow (1933&#x2013;2005), who was a drama critic, a cultural writer at <i>The New York Times</i>, and author of several books, including <i>Edward Albee: A Singular Journey</i>, and by Kenneth Holditch, professor emeritus at the University of New Orleans, editor since 1989 of the <i>Tennessee Williams Journal</i>, and the author of <i>In Old New Orleans</i>.This set collects all of Williams's plays, including the recently rediscovered early efforts Spring Storm and Not About Nightingales up through his most famous works and later lesser-known dramas. These magnificent titles are essential for all academic and public libraries. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Prayers for Rain</h2><p><p>When a former client jumps naked from a Boston landmark, Private Investigator Patrick Kenzie wants to know why. Once a perky young woman in love with life, her suicide is the final fall in a spiral of self-destruction.</p><p>What Kenzie discovers is a sadistic stalker who targeted the woman and methodically drove her to her death &#x2013; a monster that the law can&#x2019;t touch. But Kenzie can. He and his former partner, Angela Gennaro, will fight a mind-twisting battle against the psychopath, even as he turns tricks on them...</p><p><em>Prayers for Rain </em>is another superior thriller from Dennis Lehane, the bestselling and acclaimed author of <em>Mystic River, Shutter Island, </em>and <em>Gone, Baby, Gone.</em></p></p><p><i>Prayers for Rain</i> is Dennis Lehane's fifth installment in his intricately plotted, beautifully written, and much underacknowledged Boston mystery series. Lehane's books reflect our morally complex times, when the borders between right and wrong are somewhat blurry.<p> Private investigator Patrick Kenzie is in the middle of a personal crisis--he's lost his passion for the profession, and is tired of people with their "predictable vices, their predictable needs and wants and dormant desires." Angie Gennaro, his occasional sweetheart, lifelong friend, and fellow investigator has quit the business. She's still deeply resentful about Patrick's handling of the Amanda McCready case, the focus of <i>Gone, Baby, Gone</i>. Without Angie, private investigating has lost its fizz. </p><p> The suicide of a former client, Karen Nichols, gives Kenzie his investigative itch back. Six months earlier, Kenzie tracked down a stalker who had been harassing Nichols, and put an end to his heinous hobby. But Nichols needed more help than this PI could ever have imagined. "She'd been drowning, and I'd been busy." The successful, middle-class young woman had been sinking into a sea of drugs, alcohol, and prostitution, hitting the bottom when she jumped from the Boston Custom House. Her death consumes Kenzie--he is convinced that someone pulled her into the vortex, although her nearest and dearest simply call her weak. </p><p> Kenzie teams up with his explosive, loving, gun-toting friend Bubba Rogowski, and, after a boozy reunion, Angie Gennaro joins them. This fearless threesome must surely be the most original team in contemporary crime fiction. Good at the core--but seriously screwed up by various demons from their pasts--tact and decorum is hardly their style. They work their way across Boston, doing whatever it takes to question Nichols's family and acquaintances. By unveiling the real Nichols, tragic family secrets, betrayals, and conspiracies are also unmasked. </p><p> If you haven't experienced Dennis Lehane's world before, be prepared for an invigorating new reading experience. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p><p>What if a total stranger was watching your every move? What if he read your mail, listened in on your phone calls, knew what you spoke of only to your most trusted confidants? What if he learned Your routines? Your weaknesses? And, most important, what if he discovered those things you love and cling to . . . and then he stripped you of them? And sat back to watch while you self-destructed?</p><p>Boston private investigator Patrick Kenzie is about to anger such a man.</p><p>When Patrick first meets Karen Nichols, she strikes him as the kind of woman who irons her socks&#x2014;an innocent from a protected upbringing, untouched by tragedy. But six months later Karen commits suicide by leaping from one of Boston's most cherished monuments. Patrick finds himself wondering what can alter someone so drastically, so quickly, that suicide seems her only option. Yet what begins as idle curiosity soon becomes obsessive as Patrick suspects that the tragic events that befell Karen during the last months of her life&#x2014;an "accident" that destroyed her fianc�; the loss of her job, her apartment, and eventually her mind&#x2014;may not have been as random as they first appeared.</p><p>Enlisting the aid of his ex-partner and ex-flame, Angela Gennaro, as well as that of his friend, the lethally unbalanced Bubba Rogowski, Patrick enters into a treacherous game of cat-and-mouse with a man who, instead of merely killing his victims, prefers to make them wish they were dead. Through the final weeks of a stifling summer, Patrick, Angie, and Bubba wage psychological warfare with this brilliant, depraved sociopath&#x2014;a war that will bring them face-to-face with the sordid secrets of an affluent family, a brutal Mafioso, a cabal of twisted kidnappers, and a perilous encounter in the misty dark of a cranberry bog.</p><p>As the stakes grow higher and more personal, they find they might be fighting a losing battleagainst an enemy the law can't touch, who is always one step ahead of them, who is gradually learning their weaknesses, their loves, and is determined to tear their worlds apart.</p></p><h2>Chasing the Dragon</h2><p>The true story of how one woman&#39;s faith resulted in the conversion of hundreds of drug addicts, prostitues and hardened criminals in Hong Kong&#39;s infamous Walled City.</p><p>Inside of Hong Kong was the infamous Walled City. Strangers were not welcome there. Police hesitated to enter. It was a haven of filth, crime and sin. Prostitution, pornography and drug addiction flourished. Jackie Pullinger had grown up believing that if she put her trust in God, He would lead her. When she was 20 years old, God called her to the Walled City. She obeyed. And as she spoke of Jesus Christ, brutal hoods were converted, prostitutes retired from their trade and heroin junkies found new power that freed them from the bondage of drug addiction. Hundreds discovered new life in Christ. Chasing the Dragon tells the whole amazing story exactly as it happened. Equally amazing has been the reach of this ministry, now detailed in this updated and revised edition. From Hong Kong to the Philippines, Thailand and beyond, the ministry that started with Jackie and her friends taking people in to live and care for them has continued and developed to form the present St. Stephen&#x2019;s Society. Prepare to be inspired by the testimony of a life given over to the poor and forgotten and the amazing blessings that resulted.<br> <br> &nbsp;Jackie Pullinger</p><h2>A Capitol Death: A Flavia Albia Novel (Flavia Albia Series, 7)</h2><p><p><b>In Rome, ruled by the erratic Emperor Domitian, Flavia Albia is dragged into the worst sort of investigation&#x2015;a politically charged murder&#x2015;in Lindsey Davis&#x2019;s next historical mystery, <i>A Capitol Death</i>.</b></p><p>A man falls to his death from the Tarpeian Rock, which overlooks the Forum in the Capitoline Hill in Ancient Rome.

Normally, the investigation would be under the auspices of her new(ish) husband but, worried about his stamina following a long recovery, private informer Flavia Albia, daughter of Marcus Didius Falco, steps in. </p><p> What a mistake that turns out to be.

Often compared to the Kennedy clan because of the tragedies and scandals that had befallen both wealthy and powerful families, <i>Crazy Rich</i>, based on scores of exclusive, candid, on-the-record interviews, reveals how the dynasty's vast fortune was both intoxicating and toxic through the generations of a family that gave the world Band-Aids and Baby Oil. At the same time, they've been termed perhaps the most dysfunctional family in the fortune 500. Oppenheimer is the author of biographies of the Kennedys, the Clintons, the Hiltons and Martha Stewart, among other American icons.</p><p>JERRY OPPENHEIMER is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Crazy Rich: Power, Scandal, and Tragedy Inside the Johnson &amp; Johnson Dynasty</i>, as well as unauthorized biographies of Hillary and Bill Clinton, Robert F.

Many of the best known names in contemporary painting and sculpture were enrolled in those classes.It's rare to find good, comprehensive books on drawing the anatomy. Each of these the first, the return of a classic; the second, a focused study; and the third, lessons from the masters deserves a place on library shelves. Bridgman was a legendary teacher at New York's Art Students' League. There, he originated a system of drawing known as "constructive anatomy." In 1952, his seven books on anatomy were gathered into one volume, which became a standard work at art schools and universities. Published now for the first time in paperback, it holds up as an indispensable volume, with more than 200 illustrations of hands and hundreds of images of arms, shoulders, heads, torsos, legs, knees, and feet. Fairley's book concentrates on those troublesome extremities hands and feet. Sketchbook exercises are followed by eight detailed painting demonstrations in watercolor, oil, and other media. Fairley then continues on to portraits in which variations in age, skin tone, composition, mood, and movement are integrated. Advanced students will find Hale and Coyle's Anatomy Lessons from the Great Masters a rich source of inspiration. Hale, like Bridgman, was one of the great teachers at the Art Students' League. His student, Coyle, gathered together Hale's famous lectures to produce this compendium. Hale drew on principles found in 100 masterpieces by such artists as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Rubens, Raphael, D?rer, Titian, and Rembrandt. In 1995, Giovanni Civardi's trilogy Drawing Human Anatomy (Sterling, 1995), Drawing the Female Nude (Sterling, 1995), and Drawing the Male Nude (LJ 3/15/96. o.p.) reached a high standard for good, basic books in this genre. These three surpass Civardi's works and are highly recommended for serious artists and comprehensive library collections. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Teen Devotional Bible</h2><p>Being a teenager--well, it has its ups and downs.

"He" is Adam, a three-year-old who has never spoken an intelligible word.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the message is intended for Martha Beck, Adam's mother, who doesn't know whether to make a mad dash for the door to escape a raving lunatic (after all, how many conversations like this one can you have before you stop getting dinner party invitations and start pushing a mop yourself?) or accept another in a series of life lessons from an impeccable but mysterious source.<br><br>From the moment Martha and her husband, John, accidentally conceived their second child, all hell broke loose. They were a couple obsessed with success. After years of matching IQs and test scores with less driven peers, they had two Harvard degrees apiece and were gunning for more. They'd plotted out a future in the most vaunted ivory tower of academe. But the dream had begun to disintegrate. Then, when their unborn son, Adam, was diagnosed with Down syndrome, doctors, advisers, and friends in the Harvard community warned them that if they decided to keep the baby, they would lose all hope of achieving their carefully crafted goals. Fortunately, that's exactly what happened.<br><br><b>Expecting Adam</b> is a poignant, challenging, and achingly funny chronicle of the extraordinary nine months of Martha's pregnancy. By the time Adam was born, Martha and John were propelled into a world in which they were forced to redefine everything of value to them, put all their faith in miracles, and trust that they could fly without a net. And it worked.<br><br>Martha's riveting, beautifully written memoir captures the abject terror and exhilarating freedom of facing impending parentdom, being forced to question one's deepest beliefs, and rewriting life's rules. It is an unforgettable celebration of the everyday magic that connects human souls to each other.</p><p><i>Expecting Adam</i> is an autobiographical tale of an academically oriented Harvard couple who conceive a baby with Down's syndrome and decide to carry him to term. Despite everything Martha Beck and her husband John know about themselves and their belief system, when Martha gets accidentally pregnant and the fetus is discovered to have Down's syndrome, the Becks find they cannot even consider abortion. The presence of the fetus that they each, privately, believe is a familiar being named Adam is too strong. As Martha's terribly difficult pregnancy progresses, odd coincidences and paranormal experiences begin to occur for both Martha and John, though for months they don't share them with each other. Martha's pregnancy and Adam (once born) become the catalyst for tremendous life changes for the Becks.<p> Focusing primarily on the pregnancy but floating back and forth between the present and recent and distant past, Martha Beck's well-written, down-to-earth, funny, heart-rending, and tender book transcends the cloying tone of much spiritual literature. Beck is trained as a methodical academician. Because of her step-by-step explanation of her own progress from doubt to belief, she feels like a reliable witness, and even the most skeptical readers may begin to doubt their senses. When she describes an out-of-body experience, we, too, feel ourselves transported to a pungent, noisy hawker center in Singapore. We, too, feel calming, invisible, supporting hands when she falls. Yet, whether or not readers believe in Beck's experiences is ultimately a moot point. There is no doubt that Adam--a boy who sees the world as a series of connections between people who love each other--is a tremendous gift to Beck, her family, and all who have the honor of knowing him. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i></p><b>Martha Beck</b> is the "Quality of Life" columnist for <i>Mademoiselle</i>, a career counselor for Life Design Enterprises, and the author of <i>Breaking Point: Why Women Fall Apart and How They Can Re-create Their Lives</i>.

The tenuous interstellar medium isn&#x2019;t just a few atoms of hydrogen per cubic inch, forever. There are pockets of greater density, some thick enough to form strings of stars, given time. Between the dense patches there is nothing. A Bussard ramjet like Long Pass, which eats interstellar hydrogen and accelerates by spitting out fused helium, must coast between the denser clouds.<br>This is worse than it sounds. At any reasonable fraction of light speed, interstellar muck comes on like cosmic rays. As much as propulsion, a Bussard ramjet&#x2019;s purpose is to guide that lethal muck away from the life support system.<br>Every simulation run in Sol system had reached the same inconclusive conclusion: Course tweaking to exploit density fluctuations in the interstellar medium was &#x201c;likely to be&#x201d; unproductive. Between Sol and the target star the muck was thick enough. Sure, a course tweak might funnel a bit more hydrogen into the ramscoop here, but was it enough to compensate later? A slight diversion at these velocities took a heavy toll in kinetic energy. And what would you find when you reached the end of a detour? Maybe that was where the law of averages caught up with you, and the near-vacuum of interstellar gas became vacuum indeed.<br>Of course, flatlanders had built the models. Diego MacMillan had nodded noncommittally at their advice. Technically he was also a flatlander&#x2014;spacers pinned that label on every Earthborn&#x2014;but he had traveled across the solar system. Once Long Pass launched, whether he undertook the experiment was beyond their control.<br>Long Pass had followed its wobbly curves for decades now. Maybe he&#x2019;d saved a few months&#x2019; travel. That was okay. Studying the variations, plotting alternate courses, assessing probabilities&#x2014;they kept him busy. What had the experts imagined the ship&#x2019;s navigator would do for decades?<br>They could never have imagined what, in his obsessive peering ahead, he would find.<br>&#x201c;And to what do we owe this honor?&#x201d; Captain Nguyen asked.<br>Meaning that by the current schedule Diego would normally be asleep. It was all he could do not to blurt out the answer. One step at a time, he told himself. &#x201c;All will be revealed,&#x201d; he intoned with his best mock pretension.<br>The ship&#x2019;s population numbered just above ten thousand. Most were embryos, sharing the freezers with forty-three hibernating adult passengers. The crew numbered only four, between them covering three daily shifts. Together, they filled the ship&#x2019;s tiny dayroom.<br>He had arrived early to configure the claustrophobia-denying decor. Undulating, verdant forest, the Andean foothills of his youth, receded into the digital wallpaper. Fluffy clouds scudded across the brilliant blue sky glowing overhead&#x2014;he had no use for the cave-parks his Belter crewmates thought normal. Leaves rustled and insects droned softly in surround sound. Most of one wall presented a well-remembered mountain lake on which a sleek, two-toned power boat cruised. Its hundred-horsepower inboard motor was throttled down to a barely audible purr.<br>Nothing, alas, could mask the ubiquitous odor of endlessly recycled air, nor could the rough-hewn planks projected from the dayroom table disguise the plasteel slickness beneath his fingers. He twiddled the cabin controls, tuning chirps and twitters down a notch, while his curious shipmates took coffee and snacks from the synthesizer.<br>Barbara Nguyen sat first. She had the tall, gangly frame of a Belter, and her head was shaved except for a cockatoo-like Belter crest of thick black hair. She was their captain and the most cautious among them; which was cause and which effect remained stubbornly unclear to Diego. Throughout their hitherto uneventful voyage, she had let decisions emerge by consensus. With luck, consensus-seeking had become a habit.<br>Sayeed Malloum, their engineer, was taller still but stocky for a Belter. Each of them handled the tedium in his own way. Sayeed&#x2019;s latest affectation, dating back several weeks, involved dyeing his crest and disposable jumpsuit in matching colors. Today&#x2019;s hue was chartreuse, shading to deep yellow.<br>Jaime MacMillan, ship&#x2019;s doctor and Diego&#x2019;s wife of fifty years, slid into the last chair. She was built to earthly scale, nearly matching his six feet, but otherwise illustrated the old adage about opposites attracting. She was lithe while he was pot-bellied, blonde where he was dark, and as fair as he was swarthy. Those were shipboard skin tones, of course. Flatlander full-body dye jobs and elaborate skin patterns had been left on far-off Earth.<br>Jaime slipped a hand beneath the tabletop to give his knee a reassuring pat, although not even she knew what he was about to reveal. With a start, he noticed she had printed her jumpsuit in Clan MacMillan tartan: another silent vote of confidence. How anxious did he seem?<br>Barbara cleared her throat. &#x201c;Spill it, Diego. Why did you call everyone together?&#x201d;<br>Oh, how the details and analyses, all the terabytes of specifics in his personal journal, yearned to be free. This was not the time. &#x201c;Have a look.&#x201d; Above the picnic-table illusion he projected a navigational holo. Amid the scattered pink, orange-white, and yellow-white specks of the nearest stars, a brilliant green asterisk blinked: You are here. As his friends nodded recognition, he superimposed, in tints of faint gray, a delicate 3-D structure. Would they see it? &#x201c;Density variations in the interstellar gas and dust.&#x201d;<br>Sayeed frowned, likely anticipating another pitch for rerouting the ship on one more just-a-bit-off-our-planned-course wrinkle in the void.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve shared density plots before. It&#x2019;s never involved much fanfare.&#x201d; Barbara eyed him shrewdly. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;ve never before struggled so hard not to bounce in your chair.&#x201d;<br>Words alone would not suffice&#x2014;not for this, not with Belters. That was not a criticism. Growing up inside little rocks, they lacked the background. Diego said, &#x201c;Jeeves, give us Boat One.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;On full throttle, sir, as you had specified.&#x201d; The virtual speedboat slewed until its stern faced them and the shore. With a roar, the boat&#x2019;s bow rose. A great vee-shaped wake formed. Diego tracked the boat as it receded, the ripples of its wake dwindling as they spread.<br>Sayeed&#x2019;s gaze flicked between the simulated lake and the 3-D graphic that still hung above the table. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a shock wave in the interstellar gas. A... a bow wave.&#x201d;<br>Barbara narrowed her eyes in concentration. &#x201c;I concede the resemblance, but we&#x2019;re comparing two simulations. Diego, are you certain about the underlying data?&#x201d;<br>It would be so easy to dive into minutiae about years of observations patiently culled and collated, about converting those observations from the ship&#x2019;s accelerating frame of reference to a stationary frame, about estimating and correcting for the perturbations of stellar winds. He could have discussed at length vain efforts to match his readings to the sky survey with which they had departed Sol system. He yearned to explain the extrapolation of the full pattern from the mere fraction so far glimpsed, even after so many years and light-years of observations.<br>He must have had a fanatical glint in his eye, because Jaime shot him the warning look that reminded: There&#x2019;s a fine line between scary-smart and just scary. Diego kept his response to a confident nod.<br>Barbara said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll want to go through it later, step by step. No offense, just captain&#x2019;s prerogative.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What could have made this bow wave?&#x201d; Sayeed asked.<br>That was the right question. Diego started another simulation. A more nearly uniform background wash, modeled from a century-old survey, replaced the translucent ripples in the stellar display. &#x201c;This is what we expected to encounter. And... now.&#x201d;<br>A new speck, this one bright violet, materialized in the holo. Gathering speed, it recreated the 3-D shock wave.<br>Jaime stood, squeezing behind his chair to study the image from another perspective. She poked a finger into the image. &#x201c;Then whatever caused the waves is here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Obviously, the simulation runs faster than real-time. I&#x2019;ve given you no way to gauge the compression factor. The object producing the wake is moving at one-tenth cee, and we&#x2019;re nearly a light-year apart. To look at it, we aim&#x201d;&#x2014;Diego tweaked a program parameter, and a backward-extrapolated trajectory materialized&#x2014;&#x201c;where it was.&#x201d;<br>He linked their main telescope to the display. A dark sphere shimmered, faintly aglow in a false-color substitution for IR. Mountain peaks and hints of continental outlines peered out from beneath an all-encompassing blanket of ices.<br>Sayeed leaned forward to read annotations floating above the globe. &#x201c;An Earth-sized world. At one point, it was Earthlike, its oceans and atmosphere since frozen. It&#x2019;s a bit warmer than the interstellar background, which is why we can detect it, perhaps leakage from a radioactive core. And somehow, you say, it&#x2019;s racing by at one-tenth light speed. How can that be?&#x201d;<br>Barbara shook her head, setting her crest to bobbing. &#x201c;A fair question, but I have a more basic one. Diego, you might have begun by showing us what you&#x2019;d found. Why didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because this isn&#x2019;t about an out-of-place planet. I need you to accept the years of observation and the model that showed us where to look.&#x201d; Diego took a deep breath. Would they believe? &#x201c;They prove that that world has been accelerating steadily at 0.001 gee.<br>&#x201c;Someone is moving it&#x2014;someone who controls technology we can&#x2019;t even imagine.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you awake?&#x201d;<br>Diego ...</p></p><h2>Blue Moose/return of the Moose</h2><p>The adventures of a talking blue moose, who moves in with Mr. Breton and helps him run his restaurant on the edge of the big north woods</p><p></p><h2>How to Fight A Bear...and Win: And 72 Other Real Survival Tips We Hope You&#39;ll Never Need (Uncle John&#39;s Do-it-yourself Book)</h2><p>For more than 25 years, <i>Uncle John&#x2019;s Bathroom Reader</i> has helped readers learn amazing things.

Thrust into the Shakers' unfamiliar way of life, Lydia must grapple with a new world that is nothing like the one she used to know.<br><br>Now separated from her beloved brother, for men and women do not mix in this community, Lydia must adjust to many changes. But in time, and with her courageous spirit, she learns to find the joy in life again.</p><p>Lois Lowry is the author of many acclaimed books for children. She is a two-time Newbery Award winner -- for NUMBER THE STARS, a book that is required reading in many classrooms, and THE GIVER, which remains one of the most talked-about and debated books in children&#39;s publishing history. THE GIVER is soon to be a major motion picture with Walden Media. She is also the author of GOSSAMER, CROW CALL, and THE WILLOUGHBYS, among many, many others. She lives in Massachusetts with her family.Gr 3-6-Lydia Amelia Pierce, 11, and her older brother, Daniel, are sent to live in the Shaker community at Sabbathday Lake, ME, after her parents die in the 1918 influenza epidemic. Lydia must become accustomed to living, working, and learning with the Shakers and the other orphaned or abandoned children cared for at the settlement. However, Daniel toys with the idea of running away, and does indeed leave for a time. Although Lydia worries about him, her time with the Shakers is marked by a sense of acceptance and appreciation for what she has. Effective use of detail and language immerses readers in Lydia's world, especially her life with the Shakers, making for a standout historical fiction read. The book covers just six months of the children's lives. Lydia grows and changes, but her development is slow and subtle as she learns to let go of her sorrow and appreciate the simple joys in life. Pages of historical notes and photographs at the end of the book provide thorough coverage of the epidemic as well as the Shakers and Sabbathday Lake. These notes are especially helpful in clarifying which parts of the story are real and which are fiction. Readers with a high interest in historical fiction or classes studying early 20th century America, and, of course, "Dear America" fans will appreciate this novel.-Heather Talty, Lower School Library, Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School, New York City (c) Copyright 2010.

In reality, the princess is a fair and wise leader, even at a young age, with a brilliant mind for military stratagems. Her leadership skills are put to the test when war breaks out and the Dog Heads begin to move in.<p> Prolific Newbery Honor author Laurence Yep (<i>Dragon's Gate</i>) contributes a remarkable tale to the Royal Diaries series. This fictionalized account of the real-life princess will introduce young readers to a long-ago land with a fascinating culture and edge-of-seat adventures, and will certainly inspire some to delve deeper into Chinese history. As in all the titles in the series, a section in the back provides context and historical background. (Ages 8 to 14) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Gr 5-8 This entry in the series covers four months in the life of Princess Redbird, a member of the royal family of the Hsien people. Decades before, China had invaded their land and now the Hsien live in an uneasy peace with the invaders. With an eye to the future of his people, Redbird's father sends the 16-year-old to a Chinese school to learn the language and the customs of the Chinese, and also to be a representative of her people. Once there she also learns the joy of reading while studying under Master Chen. Her schooling is interrupted when a neighboring tribe, the Dog Heads, begins attacks on both the Hsien and the Chinese. The attacks escalate and all Princess Redbird's knowledge is required to help set up an alliance between the two to defeat the invaders. Before the Hsien forces triumph, many are killed, including Master Chen and Redbird's father. She, however, has discovered a talent for diplomacy and the foresight and practicality to look ahead for the good of her people. Characters are well drawn, especially Redbird and Master Chen. Historical notes are appended describing China of the sixth century and the real Lady of Ch'iao Kuo (a title bestowed years later by the Chinese). This worthy addition to this series features a feisty heroine who must take on adult responsibilities too soon. <p><i>Terrie Dorio, Santa Monica Public Library, CA</i></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Blight Way: A Sheriff Bo Tully Mystery</h2><p>A new series by the author of The Bear in the Attic finds Idaho sheriff Bo Tully&#39;s hopes about a rekindled romance with his high-school sweetheart challenged by his father&#39;s upcoming seventy-fifth birthday celebration and a ranch murder involving numerous possible suspects. 60,000 first printing.</p><p><p><b>Patrick F.

D.R.W. � AudioFile 2006, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Sexy Forever Recipe Bible: A Cookbook</h2><p>You&#x2019;re Invited to Suzanne Somer&#x2019;s Table<br>&nbsp;<br>She is known by her family and friends as a world-class cook, but you would never guess Suzanne Somers&#x2019; delicious recipes and desserts can also be used as part of her phenomenally successful weight loss plan, Sexy Forever. The Sexy Forever Recipe Bible provides a stunning compilation of more than 400 delicious classics, updated and coded for those with preferences for gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free, vegetarian, or vegan options. It&#x2019;s every recipe you need to stay sexy forever!</p><p>SUZANNE SOMERS is the author of seventeen books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Ageless</i>; <i>Keeping Secrets</i>; <i>Eat Great, Lose Weight</i>; <i>Get Skinny on Fabulous Food</i>; <i>Eat, Cheat, and Melt the Fat Away</i>; <i>Fast and Easy</i>; and <i>The Sexy Years</i>.INTRODUCTION<br><br>I love food. I have always loved food. I started cooking for my family as a young girl. I loved baking cakes. By the time I was nine, I was making beef stroganoff for the family. It was one of the few places where I had self-confidence. I was good at cooking. I received positive feedback from feeding the people I loved. That love of food almost led me to another career. After several failed TV pilots in my twenties, I had decided to give up acting. I was going to do what I knew best: cook! Life, however, doesn&#x2019;t always go as planned, and a little show called Three&#x2019;s Company got in the way of my cooking career. But it didn&#x2019;t stop my passion for food!<br><br>The Sexy Forever Recipe Bible marks my twenty-first book. You, my faithful readers, have been requesting this book for years. Many of you own some or all of my Somersize series of books with hundreds of recipes in different bindings, and you have been asking for one master book with all of them. HERE IT IS! I have taken the best of the best, revised, updated, organized, and categorized all of them to work with my amazing weight loss plan, Sexy Forever. This plan is very similar to Somersize, but with some great updates based on current science and newer discoveries related to losing weight and staying healthy.<br><br>My personal journey with weight and food began with a twiggy little body. I was one of those lucky people genetically hard-wired to be thin. Skinny. Ate whatever I wanted and didn&#x2019;t gain weight. Then I hit my forties, and what I didn&#x2019;t yet realize: the beginning of perimenopause. What were those handles on my hips? Why couldn&#x2019;t I hold in my stomach? And when I was trying to lose weight for the camera, why weren&#x2019;t the pounds flying off as they had in the past?<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t until the early &#x2019;90s that I discovered a weight loss program that allowed me to take off those nasty 15 pounds that had crept on in my forties, but without giving up the foods I loved. As a cook, it was a revelation to be able to lose weight and continue to eat incredible food--which has always been a huge part of the joy I find in each day. When you find a problem solver--especially something that can help others--I believe it is your duty to share it. This is how I became involved with weight loss and cookbooks.<br><br>The first of these books was published in 1996: Eat Great, Lose Weight. The message resonated with food lovers around the country. It was a New York Times bestseller. Not only were readers losing weight but, because of the recipes included in the book, they were learning to cook--and many told me they were eating the best food of their lives!<br><br>From there, &#x201c;Somersize&#x201d; took on a life of its own. Over the next fifteen years, I put out nine books on the subject, with more than 700 recipes. Plus, I developed numerous weight loss products, starting with a sweetener I could feel good about putting into my body: All Natural SomerSweet. With these recipes, millions have lost weight while cooking up a storm. And with each book, I updated the science, evolved the program, and added more delicious recipes.<br><br>My most recent book on health and weight loss, Sexy Forever, took the original Somersize premise, expanded it, and made it even more current by exploring the hidden obstacles to losing weight, including hormonal changes, gut health issues, and hidden food allergies. And I created an online version of the book at SexyForever.com so you can have the support you need on a daily basis. Only one thing was missing--updating the Somersize recipes to fit the revised program.<br><br>What you will notice is that none of these recipes reads like a &#x201c;diet&#x201d; recipe--because they aren&#x2019;t! Each dish starts with real food. The selection of your ingredients is the most important part of any recipe. You will see in the following pages some of my favorite spots to get real food as close to its original source as possible. I love to support local farms, farmers&#x2019; markets, the neighborhood seafood market, and more. The vendors are so proud of their food, and I feel great about putting these clean, organic (whenever possible) ingredients into my recipes. And what a difference it makes in the taste! Many of the recipes are very simple because a perfectly grown tomato with olive oil and sea salt doesn&#x2019;t need anything else. Others require a little more time to create something special. You&#x2019;ll find everything you need for any given day, divided into these categories.<br>Breakfasts Soups Salads Appetizers, Sandwiches, and Sides Dressings, Sauces, and Pesto Vegetables Rice, Beans, Pasta, and Grains Poultry Fish and Seafood Beef, Pork, and Lamb Desserts<br>Those of you following the Sexy Forever Weight Loss Plan will recognize the titles under each recipe that identify the Sexy Forever Food Groups, such as Proteins, Healthy Fats, Vegetables, Carbohydrates, and Fruit. These groups are clearly explained in Sexy Forever, where you learn how to eat these foods in combinations that maximize health and weight loss. In addition, the recipes identify the phases or levels of the program, from Detox (when you are just getting started) to Level 1 (weight loss) to Level 2 (maintenance). Again, for those on the program, these indicators will help you use the recipes as part of your weight loss plan.<br><br>For those of you not following the plan, open the book and dive in to some spectacular food! No weight loss plan is needed to enjoy the wonderful creations within. Additionally, The Sexy Forever Recipe Bible is not only organized with all your favorites, it also includes a coding system so you can easily identify any food to which you are allergic, any foods for which you may have an intolerance, or any foods you simply don&#x2019;t care to eat. Look for the following icons in the recipes.<br>gf(Gluten Free) It is now estimated that a shocking 43 percent of the population is gluten intolerant. That spectrum varies from people who are somewhat intolerant, meaning they can eat gluten only on rare occasions, all the way to those who suffer from celiac disease, the most severe form. Celiacs must avoid gluten for the rest of their lives or risk permanently damaging their intestinal lining. There is much more information on this subject in Sexy Forever, but the problem is so broad I felt it necessary to code the recipes here so you can enjoy incredible foods while avoiding obvious or hidden gluten. Of course, any of the recipes made with whole-grain flours may be made with a gluten-free flour of your choice. (Note: For the program, gluten-free flour is an Insulin Trigger, since it&#x2019;s normally made with some combination of flours from rice, corn, tapioca, etc.) I find when I cook with gluten-free flour, I need a little less (maybe 10 percent less) than regular flour. Feel free to experiment.<br><br>df (Dairy Free) For those who cannot have dairy, I have also called out hundreds of dairy-free options. Note: I do not include butter as dairy, since the milk proteins are separated out and most people can tolerate butter, even if they cannot tolerate milk. Again, adjust the recipes to your own needs.<br><br>ef (Egg Free) Since I have a severe allergy to eggs (oh, how I miss my eggs!), I have included an icon for this food. In baking, I have experimented with replacing eggs with applesauce, but I think my best results have been with milled flaxseed and water. (See details in the &#x201c;Desserts&#x201d; chapter.) When you combine them, it creates a gelatinous consistency; this mix works pretty well for cakes. Again, experiment and let&#x2019;s all share our best results!<br><br>v (Vegetarian) and vg (Vegan) For my numerous vegetarian friends and followers, again, there is a wide spectrum of people, some of whom eat fish and chicken and others who are much more strict about consuming animal proteins. I have identified vegetarian (no seafood, poultry, meat) and vegan options, and you will have no problem finding plenty of satisfying selections and making your own substitutions to fit your preferred lifestyle.<br>Throughout my life, I have tried to share my philosophy that being healthy doesn&#x2019;t have to feel like work. I don&#x2019;t diet. I don&#x2019;t slave away in a gym. I do make excellent food choices. Clean, tasty, real foods do not come processed in boxes or bags. They come from the earth, the sea, the field, or the farm. Choose these real foods whenever possible. When I don&#x2019;t or can&#x2019;t, I try to make up for it with supplements or by eating really well after the fact. I try not to deprive myself too much and not to indulge too much. It&#x2019;s a daily choice, and I know my life depends on it.<br><br>Food is thrilling. It&#x2019;s to be enjoyed, respected, and savored slowly. With more than four hundred recipes in this comprehensive recipe bible, you can take a journey through tastes from around the globe, from the simple and sublime to the bold and spicy. And your grateful body will thank you for choosing this high-quality, delicious food by rewarding you with a trim figure and extended longevity. Making this choice is the best recipe of all to keep you SEXY FOREVER! Enjoy.<br>SF (SUGAR FREE)<br><br>Why is there no icon within the recipes to indicate sf (Sugar Free)?<br><br>Eliminating sugar and foods that are accepted by the body as sugar is a cornerstone of my Sexy Forever Weight Loss Plan. Why then, some have asked, have I not included a code to indicate recipes that don&#x2019;t contain sugar? Since I don&#x2019;t use sugar in any of my recipes, there is no reason to indicate the recipes that don&#x2019;t include it! You can be certain that you will not find this ingredient anywhere in this book (unless you prefer to use it in place of the natural sweeteners I recommend). Just because I do not use sugar does not mean you have to give up sweet tastes. I use other sources for sweetening, and frankly, I don&#x2019;t even notice the difference between refined sugar and the natural sweeteners I choose.<br><br>My sweeteners of choice include organic agave nectar and All Natural SomerSweet. There has been some controversy about agave nectar recently, with some believing it has similar qualities to high-fructose corn syrup. I believe this is both an overstatement and misleading. Agave still has a much lower glycemic index than sugar and is certainly a much better choice than high-fructose corn syrup. (Agave contains fructose, which is 20 on the glycemic index, as opposed to sugar [pure glucose] which is 100.) There has also been concern about the chemicals that may be used during the manufacturing process. I always choose organic agave nectar to be certain the product is free from such chemicals.<br><br>All Natural SomerSweet is made from inulin, a naturally occurring substance found in a large number of plants, such as dandelion, wild yam, Jerusalem artichoke, onion, agave, and chicory. The natural inulin used in All Natural SomerSweet comes from chicory, which is a prebiotic fiber (2 grams per serving). Fiber is something your body needs anyway! The product also includes erythritol, another natural substance found in pears, melons, grapes, mushrooms, wine, and cheese. While categorized as a sugar alcohol, erythritol has no gassy side effects. Additionally, there is a very small amount of fructose found in our inulin blend for a small pop of sweetness, but it&#x2019;s such a low amount, our nutrition facts still boast 0 sugar grams per serving. Lastly, citrus peel extract adds a wonderful flavor to All Natural SomerSweet.<br><br>Best of all, it tastes, bakes, and acts like sugar, measuring spoon for spoon in coffee or tea and cup for cup in your favorite recipes. You will see it called for in many of these recipes, and feel free to try it in many more of your own. It is available in cans or portable packets at suzannesomers.com.<br>THE SEXY FOREVER WEIGHT LOSS PLAN<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve read Sexy Forever, you&#x2019;re already familiar with the precepts of the eating plan within its pages.

I wake each morning in my warm, safe bed next to Alan, my husband and partner of forty-three years. This is the gift in my life. How could I not choose to wake up feeling grateful? Any stage of life has its share of problems and angst, but I believe it&#x2019;s easier to choose happiness each day. Look for the good. One gift of aging is the calm that comes with it--it has given me a cool, collected approach to life. When I was younger, I often chose to be stressed and overwhelmed. With the passage of time comes wisdom and a piercing awareness of how truly blessed I am.</p><h2>100 Bullets Vol. 1: First Shot, Last Call</h2><p>Presents the stories of several people who were seriously hurt before being approached by Agent Graves, who offered each a gun, one hundred untraceable bullets, and a convincing story about whomever betrayed them.</p><p>Brian Azzarello is a relative newcomer to the comics scene, but his work on 100 Bullets and Jonny Double has catapulted him to the forefront of the ranks of contemporary comics writers.</p><h2>Community: The Structure of Belonging</h2><p>Modern society is plagued by fragmentation. The various sectors of our communities--businesses, schools, social service organizations, churches, government--do not work together. They exist in their own worlds. As do so many individual citizens, who long for connection but end up marginalized, their gifts overlooked, their potential contributions lost. This disconnection and detachment makes it hard if not impossible to envision a common future and work towards it together. We know what healthy communities look like--there are many success stories out there, and they&#39;ve been described in detail. What Block provides in this inspiring new book is an exploration of the exact way community can emerge from fragmentation: How is community built? How does the transformation occur? What fundamental shifts are involved? He explores a way of thinking about our places that creates an opening for authentic communities to exist and details what each of us can do to make that happen.</p><p><p><b>Praise for Peter Block's<br> Community: The Structure of Belonging</b></p> <p>"From the person who gave us the best book written on business stewardship comes the best book on how to transform the places where we live, work, and play into authentic, effective communities. Some of Peter Block's conclusions may surprise you, but this compelling book is a must for all who love the places we call home enough to rethink our approach to building and maintaining community."<br> --Dennis Bakke, CEO, Imagine Schools, Cofounder and CEO Emeritus, AES Corporation, and author of Joy at Work</p> <p>"Every earnest public servant, every volunteer, every disillusioned citizen, every civic leader, and every community activist or businessperson who truly want to make their communities better should read this book. It can serve as a guide or manual, but <i>Community</i> at its heart is a book of questions, and Peter gently and persistently reminds us that we are the answers."<br> --James Keene, President, Alliance for Innovation and Western Director, International City/County Management Association</p> <p>"In this wonderfully practical book, Peter Block defines the nature of a community with manageable dimensions, creative directions, and hopeful possibilities. His methods lead us to a restoration of the joy of a genuine common life."<br> --John McKnight, Professor of Education and Social Policy, and Codirector, Asset-Based Community Development Institute, Northwestern University</p> <p>"Peter Block clearly identifies the essential ingredients, qualities, questions, atmosphere. and actions needed to create and build vital communities filled with possibility, generosity, accountability, and deep engagement. Outstanding in its relevance, practicality, and clarity."<br> --Angeles Arrien, PhD, cultural anthropologist and author of <i>The Second Half of Life: Opening the Eight Gates of Wisdom</i></p> <p>"This book is more than practical advice on execution of theory; it is a spiritual primer for the building up of community and transforming hope that we so desperately need in today's world. Peter has touched us once again in that place we call `soul'".<br> --Clint Kemp, Founding Pastor, New Providence Community Church</p> <p>"Peter's work has become the cornerstone of how our police department has developed over the years. What we have pleasantly discovered is that the more our capacity grows to work in partnership with each other, the more our capacity to serve our community is enhanced."<br> --Michael Butler, Chief of Police, Longmont, Colorado</p> <p>"After being engaged for many years with transformations in the U.S., Latin America, and Africa, it is exciting to find a practical and deep methodology that integrates great ideas and points at new applications. Peter's book is critical for anyone concerned about reenergizing the quality of life in our workplaces and in our communities."<br> --Steve Zaffron, CEO, the Vanto Group, a Landmark Education Company</p><p><b>Community</b></p> <p>Most of our communities are fragmented and at odds within themselves. Businesses, social services, education, and health care each live within their own worlds. The same is true of individual citizens, who long for connection but end up marginalized, their gifts overlooked, their potential contributions lost. What keeps this from changing is that we are trapped in an old and tired conversation about who we are. If this narrative does not shift, we will never truly create a common future and work toward it together.</p> <p>What Peter Block provides in this inspiring new book is an exploration of the exact way community can emerge from fragmentation. How is community built? How does the transformation occur? What fundamental shifts are involved? What can individuals and formal leaders do to create a place they want to inhabit? We know what healthy communities look like--there are many success stories out there. The challenge is how to create one in our own place.</p> <p>Block helps us see how we can change the existing context of community from one of deficiencies, interests, and entitlement to one of possibility, generosity, and gifts. Questions are more important than answers in this effort, which means leadership is not a matter of style or vision but is about getting the right people together in the right way: convening is a more critical skill than commanding. As he explores the nature of community and the dynamics of transformation, Block outlines six kinds of conversation that will create communal accountability and commitment and describes how we can design physical spaces and structures that will themselves foster a sense of belonging.</p> <p>In <i>Community</i>, Peter Block explores a way of thinking about our places that creates an opening for authentic communities to exist and details what each of us can do to make that happen.</p></p><h2>Beyond the Ice Limit: A Gideon Crew Novel (Gideon Crew Series)</h2><p><b>BEYOND THE ICE LIMIT</b><br><i>That thing is growing again. We must destroy it. The time to act is now...</i><br>With these words begins Gideon Crew's latest, most dangerous, most high-stakes assignment yet. Failure will mean nothing short of the end of humankind on earth.<br>Five years ago, the mysterious and inscrutable head of Effective Engineering Solutions, Eli Glinn, led a mission to recover a gigantic meteorite--the largest ever discovered--from a remote island off the coast of South America. The mission ended in disaster when their ship, the Rolvaag, foundered in a vicious storm in the Antarctic waters and broke apart, sinking-along with its unique cargo-to the ocean floor. One hundred and eight crew members perished, and Eli Glinn was left paralyzed.<br>But this was not all. The tragedy revealed something truly terrifying: the meteorite they tried to retrieve was not, in fact, simply a rock. Instead, it was a complex organism from the deep reaches of space.<br>Now, that organism has implanted itself in the sea bed two miles below the surface-and it is growing. If it is not destroyed, the planet will be doomed. There is only one hope: for Glinn and his team to annihilate it, a task which requires Gideon's expertise with nuclear weapons. But as Gideon and his colleagues soon discover, the "meteorite" has a mind of its own-and it has no intention of going quietly...<b><br></b></p><p>Preston and Child are co-authors of the Agent Pendergast series as well as the Gideon Crew series. Their novels <i>Relic</i> and <i>The Cabinet of Curiosities</i> were chosen in an NPR poll as two of the hundred greatest thrillers ever written. Preston's acclaimed nonfiction book, <i>The Monster of Florence</i>, is being made into a movie. Lincoln Child has published six novels of his own, including the bestseller <i>The Forgotten Room</i>."Preston &amp; Child take all of the various elements from classic horror and sci-fi films and novels and spin them together to write what begins as an action adventure, but soon delves into paranoid terror ... scary good fun."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Associated Press</em></i></b><br><br>"The always sensational duo is back with a work that is as exciting and intriguing as it is fast-paced."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Suspense Magazine</em></i></b><br><br>"This duo is magnificent.

Michigan's Upper Peninsula might be the best place to live at other times, but June was pure misery in the deep woods.</p> <p>Her German shepherd-chow search dog, Samson, wagged his curly tail in an effort to dispel the clouds of black flies buzzing around his head. He raced ahead of her, pausing occasionally to look behind as if to say, "Are you coming?"</p> <p>Naomi O'Reilly, Bree's best friend and search-and-rescue partner, panted to keep up. "You think he's dead?" she asked.</p> <p>Bree didn't pause to answer. It was a useless question anyway. The only way to answer that would be to find the body. She thrashed her way through the clinging blackberry bushes onto a small beach fronting Lake Michigan. The beach had managed to hold back the encroaching north woods and seemed almost hidden by the sunlight-choking tall trees surrounding it. The sandy area was already full of deputies and searchers. She scanned the shore for her brother-in-law, Sheriff Mason Kaleva, and saw his bulky form directing the searchers about to begin dragging the lake.</p> <p>She almost groaned when she saw who was standing beside him. Ranger Kade Matthews's gaze met hers, and she wished she could leave. But this was a small community, and people already talked enough about their breakup. She tried to smile but feared it was more of a grimace when Kade's own expression darkened. </p> <p>Samson bounded across the damp sand to greet him. Kade scratched the dog's ears, then walked away to join other rangers and Mason's deputies at the water's edge. As head of security on the Kitchigami Wildlife Preserve, he had every right to be here, Bree told herself, hurrying to join Mason and Samson. At least she wouldn't have to pretend nothing was wrong. But if this breakup had been the right thing, why did it hurt so much?</p> <p>"Anything?" she asked Mason.</p> <p>Mason shook his head. "This is a heck of a way to introduce the new residents to Rock Harbor. The chamber of commerce coaxed the lab to open here by painting a pretty picture of all the recreation in the Keweenaw. Now it will look like the area is unsafe."</p> <p>"He might just be lost," Bree reminded him. "Maybe he never went out on the lake."</p> <p>"He was due home four hours ago," Mason said. "His fishing gear is still by the water. Besides, he's a no-show at his son's fifth birthday party. Not like him at all, according to his wife."</p> <p>She couldn't argue with that, and it didn't bode well. She glanced at her watch. Two o'clock. Her son, Davy, was at the party with his friend Timmy, Naomi's stepson. The sound of the waves seemed louder, and a few raindrops hit her arm. "Storm's coming. We'd better get out there." </p> <p>Naomi and her dog, Charley, hurried toward her. None of the other Kitchigami K9 Search and Rescue members had arrived yet. Bree turned back to Mason. "You have a boat for us?"</p> <p>Mason nodded his head toward a dinghy. "I thought you'd like something low to the water. It's got an engine as well as oars."</p> <p>"Perfect. You have the scent article?" Mason handed her a paper bag. She unrolled it and then another paper bag inside the first one. "Come, Samson."</p> <p>The dog eagerly sniffed the sock inside the bags then woofed softly. Bree handed the bag to Naomi, and Charley sniffed it as well. Both dogs turned and looked out toward the lake. Not a good sign. Bree had hoped the man had put in to shore somewhere. He was a scientist, not a sailor. Only people experienced with Lake Superior had any business out on its capricious waves.</p> <p>Once they were in the boat, Mason shoved them off. Samson immediately went to the bow. The wind blew his thick, curly fur back from his head. "Find him, Samson," Bree urged. The dog whined, and his tail dropped between his legs. The hope of finding new resident Phil Taylor alive began to wane. </p> <p>Naomi had the motor barely putt-putting along. She steered it slowly back and forth across the inlet near the beach. The clouds were already turning darker, and a drop or two of rain plopped into the water. Charley and Samson had their noses in the air. Samson gave a howl, then strained toward shore near an outcropping of rock called Three Indians. </p> <p>"Over there!" Bree pointed and Naomi turned the boat.</p> <p>Charley whined and turned his head back to look at Naomi. Samson howled again then launched himself into the four-foot swells. Biting at the water, he paddled toward the rocks.</p> <p>"Samson, no!" The way the waves were pounding the rocks, Bree was afraid her dog would be tossed against the granite and killed. The dog hesitated then turned and paddled back to the boat. </p> <p>"Over here," Bree shouted to Mason. "Bring the nets here." She tossed the anchor overboard and hauled Samson back into the boat. The average water temperature in Lake Superior was only forty degrees, and she shivered when seventy pounds of cold, wet dog landed next to her. She pulled a towel out of her ready-pack and began to dry him off.</p> <p>Anything was better than facing what her dog's reaction might mean. Though she'd had her share of searches ending badly, she was never prepared when it happened. Rubbing the towel rhythmically over her dog's wet fur, she prayed for Phil Taylor's family. </p> <p>"He's got a wife and three kids," Naomi said, her gaze on the boats beginning to drag the lake. </p> <p>Bree nodded. "I met her at the Suomi last week when she invited the kids over for the birthday party. She seemed so sweet. Poor woman."</p> <p>"You don't suppose he went swimming here, do you? It's too early in the season to even think of getting in that water. I wouldn't get in it until July."</p> <p>"I don't know. Some people new to the area just don't know any better." Bree watched until one of the searchers shouted, then she turned her face away as the nets found what they were looking for.</p> <p>Mason pulled his boat alongside Bree a few minutes later. "It's Phil. Your boys are at their house, right? You might as well come with me to tell his wife. I think she'll need a familiar face. She's so far from her family."</p> <p>Bree wanted to refuse, but she hunched her shoulders and nodded.</p> <p>~</p> <p>The Taylors lived in a small cottage at the edge of Rock Harbor. A rental, the cottage seemed to cling for dear life to the thick woods behind it as it looked over a small cliff at Lake Superior's seasonal fury. The storm had passed by but the effects still lingered; monster waves crashed against the rocks below.</p> <p>Children squealed in the yard, and Bree could see Davy stomping in a mud puddle. No matter how often she looked at her son, she marveled at the perfection of his compact body, a miniature version of his dead father. Her vision blurred as her gaze wandered to Adrian. He was fatherless now, too, but just didn't know it. Life seemed so unfair at times. </p> <p>"Those boys are covered in mud." Naomi's voice was resigned.</p> <p>Adults mingled with the children, and Bree glanced at her watch. "It's pickup time. Maybe we should wait until most of the people are gone to break the news to Denise."</p> <p>Mason hesitated, then nodded. "I hope the storm didn't flood the mine where the new lab is set up. It's the craziest thing I've ever heard. Who in their right mind would try to grow plants inside a mine? And for what purpose when there are perfectly good places to grow it outside?"</p> <p>"They're sure tight-lipped about it," Naomi agreed. "But MJ Pharmaceuticals must know what they're doing."</p> <p>"You'd think so. Hilary was ecstatic when she heard they'd be employing nearly fifty people. Especially with her reelection coming up in a few months."</p> <p>Naomi nodded. "She's always on top of everything. I wish she'd slow down." </p> <p>Bree knew her sister-in-law would never do that. She and Rob, Bree's deceased husband, were as alike in temperament as they were in looks, both focused and driven when they attacked a project. "How is Hilary feeling? I haven't seen her since last week."</p> <p>"Sick of taking it easy, but feeling pretty good. You should see the bedroom. She's transformed it into an office complete with fax machine. Her secretary comes there every morning. She's nearly four months along now. Just another two months, and we'll all breathe easier."</p> <p>Denise was giving prizes out for the last game. She turned, and her expression changed when she saw Bree's Jeep. The one-year-old twins clutched her legs, one on each side. Kneeling, she scooped them up and came toward the car. Bree and Mason got out and waited for her.</p> <p>"Did you find him?" Her lips trembled, and she pressed them together. </p> <p>"Maybe we should go inside." Mason said.</p> <p>She didn't seem to hear him. "Phil isn't usually so irresponsible. Did he say why he didn't let me know he would be home so late?"</p> <p>Little Abby had her thumb in her mouth and smiled winningly at Bree. Alex began wailing, his fists rubbing his eyes.</p> <p>"May I?" Bree held out her hands for the crying child. To her amazement, Alex came right to her and cuddled against her shoulder. With Davy now nearly five, it was hard to remember when he'd been this small. </p> <p>"He's not usually so outgoing with strangers," Denise said. She shuffled Abby to the other hip. "Did Phil say what time he'd be home?" Her voice was high and jerky, and she didn't look at either Bree or Mason.</p> <p>"Mrs. Taylor, I'm afraid I have some bad news," Mason began. </p> <p>"Oh, don't tell me he wrecked the car." Denise gave a nervous laugh. "I told him he needed to get new tires before we moved up here."</p> <p>"No, the car is fine. But I'm afraid Phil isn't. We found his body in Lake Superior, ma'am, just off Three Indians beach area."</p> <p>Denise stared at them, her mouth slack. She blinked through glazed eyes. "Wha . . . what are you saying?

First published in 1853, &#34;Villette&#34; is Bronte&#39;s most accomplished and deeply felt work, eclipsing even &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; in critical acclaim. Her narrator, the autobiographical Lucy Snowe, flees England and a tragic past to become an instructor in a French boarding school in the town of Villette. There, she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquetter. This first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape. Yet in spite of adversity and disappointment, Lucy Snowe survives to recount the unstinting vision of a turbulent life&#39;s journey--a journey that is one of the most insightful fictional studies of a woman&#39;s consciousness in English literature.</p><p>Arguably Bronte&#39;s most refined and deeply felt work, Villette draws on her experiences as a student in Brussels as well as her profound loneliness following the deaths of her three siblings. Lucy Snowe, the narrator of Villette, flees from an unhappy past in England to begin a new life as a teacher at a French boarding school in the great cosmopolitan capital of Villette. Soon Lucy&#39;s struggle for independence is overshadowed by both her friendship with a worldly English doctor and her feelings for an autocratic schoolmaster. Bronte&#39;s strikingly modern heroine must decide if there is any man in her society with whom she can live and still be free.Tim Dolin is at University of Newcastle.</p><h2>Amarcord: Marcella Remembers</h2><p><b>Beloved teacher and bestselling cookbook author Marcella Hazan tells how a young girl raised in Emilia-Romagna became America?s godmother of Italian cooking </b><br><br> Widely credited with introducing proper Italian food to the English-speaking world, Marcella Hazan is as authentic as they come. Raised in Cesenatico, a quiet fishing town on the northern Adriatic Sea, she?s eventually have her own cooking schools in New York, Bologna, and Venice and teach students from around the world to appreciate and produce the food that native Italians eat. She?d write bestselling and award-winning cookbooks, collect invitations to cook at top restaurants, and have thousands of loyal students and readers. <br><br> When Marcella met the love of her life, Victor, they married and moved to New York City. She knew not a word of English or?what?s more surprising?a single recipe. She longed for the flavors of her homeland and attempted to re-create them. One day Craig Claiborne invited himself to lunch, and the rest is history. <br><br> <i>Amarcord</i> means ?I remember? in Marcella?s native Romagnolo dialect. In these pages, Marcella looks back on the adventures of a life lived for pleasure and a love of teaching. Throughout, she entertains the reader with stories of the twists and turns that brought her love, fame and a chance to change the way we eat forever.</p><p>Recipient of two Lifetime Achievement Awards (from the James Beard Foundation in 2000 and IACP in 2004), and a knighthood from her own country, Marcella Hazan is the author of six classic cookbooks published over the past thirty-five years. She lives in Longboat Key, Florida, with her husband, Victor, her lifelong collaborator and writing partner, himself an authority on Italian food and wine.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Nancy McKeon All the atmospherics of those Olive Garden "abbondanza" TV commercials aside, Italians can be a stern lot when it comes to food. And in the field of Italian cookery, the role of taskmaster has fallen for the past several decades to Marcella Hazan, author of six major cookbooks and widely regarded as the person who taught America how to cook Italian. Now 84, Hazan, retired and living in Florida, has produced a memoir, Amarcord (Romagnolo dialect for "I remember"), in which she recounts how a young girl trained to teach science in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy came to lead Americans out of the great miasma of red sauce. The general outline may be known among foodies, but it's charming enough to bear repeating: In the late 1960s, Hazan was taking Chinese cooking courses in her adopted city of New York when her fellow students asked her to teach them to cook Italian. She tried to get the New York Times to publicize her classes, and eventually food writer Craig Claiborne invited himself to a working lunch. "It was October 15, 1970," Hazan writes. "I have never since then had to be concerned about how to occupy my time." Hazan taught courses around the world, with students paying thousands of dollars for the opportunity to be held to her high standards. What I've left out of the above outline is perhaps the biggest factor in Hazan's life: Victor Hazan, the Italian-born, American-raised son of Manhattan furriers who whisked a young Marcella Polini Hazan off to New York in the first place. He's the one who liked to come home from the office for a traditional lunch every day, encouraging his young wife to venture into her new city and language by shopping the local markets. He applauded her foray into cooking, then into cooking classes, then became her collaborator, honing her recipes and translating them into English for her first tome, The Classic Italian Cookbook, published in 1973. The Victor Hazan revealed in this book is formidable. Victor doesn't like chicken, Marcella tells us, so she makes no chicken (left unsaid is where her chicken recipes come from). Describing the bathroom renovations to their Venice apartment, she says, "He allowed me to keep the tub, but everything else had to go." And elsewhere, "It always went Victor's way." But if Victor is stubborn, so is she. "I did not allow comings and goings during [cooking lessons], and I did not accept anyone coming late," she writes. "Anyone who refused [to clean squid] was asked to leave the class, and none ever did." She makes one half-hearted attempt to blame her moods on a longtime assistant, Maria, who "worked with a scowl and a heavy heart," surmising that "some of that glumness had started to rub off on me." The first chapters of the book are delightful. "Little is left of the world I was born into eighty-four years ago," Hazan begins, going on to describe a home where food was provided by nearby farms and summers were spent by the water in Hazan's native Cesenatico, on the Adriatic Sea. When the book moves to the more workaday world of cooking classes and book contracts, the charm begins to fade. We meet just about every boldface name the Hazans have ever encountered -- Burt Lancaster, Danny Kaye, James Beard, Julia Child -- and a verdict is rendered on each and every one. In short, the book is a kind of accounting ledger: Who loyally stood by the Hazans and who did not. Her original publisher? "As far as I could see, he could do nothing right." Chuck Williams, founder of the Williams-Sonoma chain? Still under suspicion for not confirming whether Hazan introduced his sales team to balsamic vinegar. The black list goes on: Bloomingdale's, which replaced Hazan's street-front shop with one for Michel Gu�rard; her former partners in an Atlanta restaurant that slipped into foreclosure; the city of Bologna, which didn't pony up a new location for a cooking school when Hazan's first lease ran out. What you wind up thinking about Amarcord, then, may depend less on how much you treasure Marcella Hazan's teaching than on how deep into the dirty dishwater you want to sink your arms. <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

In this enthralling work, Maria Tatar challenges many of our assumptions about childhood reading. Much as our culture pays lip service to the importance of literature, we rarely examine the creative and cognitive benefits of reading from infancy through adolescence. By exploring how beauty and horror operated in C.S. Lewis&#x2019;s <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em>, Philip Pullman&#x2019;s <em>His Dark Materials</em>, J.K. Rowling&#x2019;s Harry Potter novels, and many other narratives, Tatar provides a delightful work for parents, teachers, and general readers, not just examining how and what children read but also showing through vivid examples how literature transports and transforms children with its intoxicating, captivating, and occasionally terrifying energy. In the tradition of Bruno Bettelheim&#x2019;s landmark <em>The Uses of Enchantment</em>, Tatar&#x2019;s book is not only a compelling journey into the world of childhood but a trip back for adult readers as well. 30 illustrations</p><p>Maria Tatar chairs the Program in Folklore and Mythology at Harvard University. She is the author of Enchanted Hunters: The Power of Stories in Childhood, Off with Their Heads! Fairy Tales and the Culture of Childhood and many other books on folklore and fairy stories. She is also the editor and translator of The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales, The Annotated Peter Pan, The Classic Fairy Tales: A Norton Critical Edition and The Grimm Reader. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Michael Dirda Maria Tatar is the John L. Loeb Professor of Germanic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University. Many of us would expect the holder of such an august title to be an authority on, say, "The Nibelungenlied" or Goethe or the novels of Thomas Mann. In fact, Tatar may be our leading scholar of children's literature and of the fairy tale in particular. Two of her more recent books include "The Annotated Brothers Grimm" and "The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen." I want to stress that word "scholar." Early in her introduction to "Enchanted Hunters," Tatar writes that in her courses on children's literature, the students naively "insisted on magic, on the incandescent beauty of the stories, and on the Wordsworthian 'attendant gleams / Of soul-illumination' that accompanied their readings. By contrast, I was eager to break the spell, to demystify and disenchant, moving from reading for pleasure to reading for hidden meanings, symbolic codes, and narrative technique." So be warned: "Enchanted Hunters" is full of insights into "the power of stories in childhood," but its tone is often that of the seminar. Tatar conveniently summarizes her book's aims at the end of her introduction: "I will begin this volume, after a chapter on the origins of childhood stories, by examining the power surges that come with reading and by exploring how books can ignite the imagination. Literature for children enthralls and entrances in large part through the shock effects of beauty and horror. Those moments, in all their unstudied power, are what lure children into a world made up of letters, and they constitute the subject matter of chapters 2 and 3. The final two chapters look at the cognitive gains provided by literacy, showing that children learn, through stories, how to do things with words even as words do things to them. In these chapters, I take up the notion of reading as a process of discovery and explore how that process engages three dominant features in the emotional landscape of the child: boredom, wonder, and curiosity." Tatar then proceeds to a discussion of what it means to read at bedtime, starting with those long centuries of communal tale-telling around the hearth: "The light of the blazing fire combined with the dark, gloomy shadows by the hearth to transmit sharp contrasts, shaping the expectations of listeners and inspiring the tellers. It is no accident that fairy-tale worlds enact struggles between the powers of light and darkness and choreograph collisions between beauty and horror. The atmosphere in which they flourished rippled and flowed with those contrasts." Beauty and horror are central to fairy tales. Such narratives, Tatar writes, usually suggest wondrous beauty by highlighting "the production of radiance (light, glass, gold, and brilliant hues), an insistence on abstract adjectives ('exquisite,' 'lovely,' and 'enchanting'), and descriptions of rapturous contemplation." Everything beautiful "glitters, dazzles, and shines," chiefly because of "metals, ice, glass, mirrors, silver and gold." But if beauty is "abstractly luminous," horror is "depicted not only with detailed specificity but also with astonishing variety." Tatar lists a few of those fairy-tale horrors, sometimes toned down or eliminated in modern retellings: "In the Grimms' 'Snow White,' iron shoes are heated over a fire, and the evil stepmother is forced to dance to her death in 'red-hot iron shoes.' In Andersen's 'Little Match Girl,' we not only see the child 'huddled between two houses, with rosy cheeks and a smile on her lips,' but we also learn that she had 'frozen to death' and that the New Year is dawning on the 'frozen body of the little girl, who was still holding matches in her hand.' In Andrew Lang's Yellow Fairy Book, the Sun-Hero fends off ferocious wolves night after night. Finally, his strength fails him. He falls asleep, and a crab crawls toward him and 'with its claws tore out his tongue.' The princess who lives at the top of the glass mountain in that same collection sits at the window of her castle, gazing out at 'the heap of corpses both of riders and horses' and at the 'many dying men' who lie in her courtyard, 'unable to go any further with their wounded limbs.' " Horror naturally leads Tatar into the subject of death. In Chapter 3 she discusses children's prayers, the Victorian ideal of a "beautiful death," and the boom 30 years ago in high trauma young-adult novels: "According to one count, more than two hundred books of fiction for children took up the theme of death in the 1970s and 1980s." Tatar shows that dealing with fear of the dark -- and, by extension, with the fear of extinction -- forms a major subtext of such picture book classics as Margaret Wise Brown and Clement Hurd's "Goodnight Moon" and Maurice Sendak's "In the Night Kitchen." Even more directly, death proves a major theme of E.B. White's "Charlotte's Web," beginning with its famous opening line: "Where's Papa going with that ax?" In her fourth chapter, "The Magic Art of the Great Humbug," Tatar addresses the power of curses, spells and charms to change reality (in fairy tales, at least), but also how books like L. Frank Baum's "The Wizard of Oz," Frances Hodgson Burnett's "The Secret Garden" and Norton Juster's "The Phantom Tollbooth" "champion the importance of learning how to do things with words, hinting that control over language conquers helplessness and vulnerability, leading to confidence and authority." In her final chapter, Tatar turns to the connected themes of boredom, curiosity and wonder. How many books, she notes, begin with kids complaining that they are bored with nothing to do? So many of our great children's classics -- she points to Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," J.M. Barrie's "Peter Pan" and Dr. Seuss's "The Cat in the Hat" -- underscore that an engaged curiosity offers the cure for boredom. In its turn, curiosity will then lead to the discovery that the world is full of wonder, as Marco discovered in Dr. Seuss's "And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street." Tatar's evocative title, "Enchanted Hunters," derives from Nabokov's "Lolita," where the phrase forms one of the book's leitmotifs -- it is, for instance, the name of the hotel to which Humbert takes Lolita. But Tatar staunchly hopes to "reclaim" the term as a description of the child as reader, "curious, energetic, and enthralled." To show more precisely what she means, she concludes her book with a long appendix in which dozens of writers -- from Frederick Douglass and Walt Whitman to Rita Dove and Harold Bloom -- testify to the power of childhood reading. So, in the end, "Enchanted Hunters" paradoxically takes us right back to accounts of -- what else? -- magic, incandescent beauty and Wordsworthian gleams of "soul-illumination." <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

I&#x2019;m pulling that number from memory, so it may be inexact, if anything too low, but the point stands. <br>I suspected that in the end humans would walk into this weather&#x2014;I remember feeling a spark of excitement when a &#x201c;cart&#x201d; threatened to provide me with some in <i>Return of the Native</i>&#x2014;but I attached no special primacy to them. I rarely made it further than six or seven paragraphs into any of those books, which left my illusions about their nature intact. Finally when I was twelve some intelligent adult&#x2014;likely my mother&#x2014;got it over with and gave me <i>The Catcher in the Rye,</i> and I found the same banal and vibrant sanities everyone does in that book. <br>Really, those novels were right, however: There are times in life when the weather and the landscape seem suddenly as if they&#x2019;re for you alone, and for a moment there&#x2019;s a novelistic pressure, an interiority, to gazing out through a window at the snow, or the sun. <br>I&#x2019;m thinking of the late August afternoon when I was supposed to leave New York for England. It was uncommonly cold for the month, and there was a heavy rain, the kind of day that reminds you, oh, of course, the other seasons are coming soon. <br>&#x201c;Are you hungry?&#x201d; Alison asked. <br>I shook my head. &#x201c;Not especially.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Come on, we&#x2019;re forgetting something. You had pizza last night, we got soup from Veselka. What else are you going to miss?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, you.&#x201d; My tone had it both ways, mocking this kind of straightforward tenderness and taking credit for it, too. <br>She rolled her eyes. &#x201c;My hero.&#x201d; <br>We were in the living room of our apartment on Horatio Street. Its estranging collocation of familiar objects&#x2014;its picture frames, its hanging garden of pots, its chromatically organized bookshelves&#x2014;seemed so much like a vision of life to me, now that I was leaving. <br>&#x201c;I should go soon anyway. I have to check all these bags.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; She stood up, her long brown hair falling down her shoulders. There was a tangle of silver necklaces spilling in and out of the top of her shirt, and her sweet, intelligent face&#x2014;prone to worry&#x2014;was drawn inward with concentration. &#x201c;Last check, then. You have the bag of medicines I packed for you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And you have a sweater handy in case it&#x2019;s cold when you get in.&#x201d; <br>I pointed toward the largest suitcase. &#x201c;Yep.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And do you have a book?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>The Captive Mind,</i> it&#x2019;s sitting right in the outer pocket of the blue bag. With my headphones. And the sweater.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And that bag of pretzels I got you for a snack?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And that bag of pretzels you got me for a snack.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And your passport.&#x201d; <br>I felt my eyes widen. &#x201c;Oh, no.&#x201d; <br>She smiled to acknowledge the joke, and then when my face didn&#x2019;t change her expression grew uncertain. &#x201c;Wait, are you kidding?&#x201d; <br>I stood up, my ears hot, my face tingling. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even think about it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Where did you leave it after you got your visa?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Seriously, I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; <br>We spent the next fifteen minutes rifling through our uncluttered apartment like thieves. I inspected every pile of paper I could find, old bills, Christmas cards, making no effort to reassemble them before I moved on. How long did it take to get a passport? Or could Alison&#x2019;s dad get me a temporary one, good for a week or two until she could find mine and overnight it to England? <br>I was in the bedroom, sifting through our drawers of clothes, mine empty now, when I heard her call out. &#x201c;I found it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh God, thank fuck.&#x201d; I ran to the living room, where she held the passport up in triumph. &#x201c;Is that definitely it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, it was next to mine. From Montreal in July.&#x201d; <br>I took it and flipped to my picture to make sure. &#x201c;Jesus. Thank you.&#x201d; <br>I looked around. &#x201c;The apartment is a disaster. I should clean.&#x201d; <br>She looked at her watch. &#x201c;No, no, you don&#x2019;t have time. I&#x2019;ll tidy it up when you&#x2019;re gone.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thanks, babe.&#x201d; I put the passport in my pocket, a stiff, awkward panel of hide. &#x201c;Should we go downstairs?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just come lie with me for a minute first, would you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;In bed?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; <br>We went into the bedroom. She kicked off her shoes and slipped herself into the sheets, and as I followed her in she pulled me close, her encircling arms a loose, too loose, fortification, the walls of a city anybody could get into or out of. &#x201c;A whole year,&#x201d; she murmured after a minute. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not even that long.&#x201d; <br>I loved her more than I had in months, months. Our breath began to even out, the silence of the battering rain. I looked at the bedroom, gray in the unlit afternoon, at the cheerful battalion of photographs of us along her dresser, and next to them at her perfume bottles, clustered in their leather tray. The quiet disloyalty of objects. How serious it is to be young! <br>It seemed impossible that the next morning I wouldn&#x2019;t blunder sleepily out of that bed, that it would be elsewhere, in different time. <br>Alison and I had first lain together this way four years before, during college. We had been on a few dates already, but there was still a formal element to our conversations, even our kisses. One Saturday my friends Geoff, Ben, and I spent a few hours throwing a football to each other on Old Campus. We stopped as it began to get dark, and even though I was hot and dusty I decided to drop by her room; I hadn&#x2019;t been there yet. She lived in Connecticut Hall, a building made of that salmon-white brick common to all of the remaining colonial houses in New England, on the third floor. <br>She answered the door in a hoodie and navy shorts, with YALE written in white along the hem on her left thigh. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she said and looked past me up and down the hallway, as if I might be part of a group. &#x201c;Is everything okay?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah, I just wanted to say hi.&#x201d; <br>She looked puzzled for another instant, but then her face opened with comprehension. &#x201c;Oh, good, sure. Come in. I was watching TV.&#x201d; <br>We sat on her bed to watch together. I fell asleep right away. I remember briefly waking, feeling cold and shifting my weight into her body. Her hand was stroking my head, and her neck, where my face was buried, was warm and fragrant and sleepy, like a hayfield at the end of summer. <br>Now, essentially for the first time since then, our two bodies would be apart, we would be apart. She looked at me. &#x201c;Are you sure I can&#x2019;t come to the airport?&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;No, no, go to the fund-raiser.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; She looked at her watch. &#x201c;You should leave, you&#x2019;ll never be able to get a cab in this weather.&#x201d; <br>In fact I got a cab immediately, my day&#x2019;s travel misfortune already allotted to the passport scare, and we loaded my bags into the trunk and the backseat. <br>&#x201c;Look out for some treats,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They might be squashed, I guess.&#x201d; <br>I smiled. Whenever I went on trips alone I would find things that she had tucked into my luggage, magazines, Snickers bars. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; <br>She gave me a kiss. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you soon.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;In a month. It&#x2019;s practically tomorrow.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ha.&#x201d; <br>I got into the cab. She was standing with her arms folded, watching me, from the dry of the awning. I got out and gave her a last kiss on the cheek, and she smiled and squeezed my hand. Then I left. <br>Right then I wanted what we all want: both things; to leave and to stay at the same time. I looked through the window at the wet-blurred taillights of the cabs around me, their brightness an increasing proportion of everything visible out in the world. I remembered that day in college, how after we woke up Alison and I had spent half an hour making a poster to welcome Bill Clinton to a meeting. We both belonged to the lower reaches of the upper reaches of the byzantine bureaucracy that ran the Yale Democrats. That was how we&#x2019;d met. <br>&#x201c;What should I put?&#x201d; she asked, sitting cross-legged, marker in hand, hair back in a ponytail. <br>&#x201c;I would avoid mentioning blow jobs.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What about kneepads? Or impeachment? Or Ken Starr? Or Whitewater?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Maybe impeachment if you have a good joke.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, come on, what should I put?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hm. Maybe something about Bulldogs? Go Bulldogs? Bulldogs for Bill?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m going to draw some bunting and write just &#x2018;Welcome Home,&#x2019; in big letters,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;ll appreciate that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll definitely come in handy the next time you go to a rally in Arkansas.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He went to school here. That&#x2019;s like a home.&#x201d; <br>As the cab moved north toward the Midtown Tunnel, I opened the outer pocket of my suitcase to fetch my book and came across a bag of Twizzlers, which had been on Alison&#x2019;s list of the foods they didn&#x2019;t have in England. I opened it and ate one and thought of that phrase, <i>That&#x2019;s like a home</i>. I had reached the age by then, twenty-five, when I had finally stopped believing, in some illogical and hopeful chamber of my heart, that one day we might all gather up our things, reassemble, my friends and I, Alison, and go back to school again together. Yet here I was, returning in a way. Without them, fine; but without her, that seemed unkind. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>My first exchange with an English person was at Immigration. <br>&#x201c;Coming from?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;New York.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t bring anything dangerous or alive, did you now?&#x201d; <br>I laughed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d; <br>He gave me a sharp look. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>He looked down at my immigration card. &#x201c;Says here you&#x2019;re going up to uni, then? English literature?&#x201d; <br>He said these last two words as if they were individually irreproachable but hilariously stupid side by side. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; <br>He stamped my passport. &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re not so clever yet.&#x201d; <br>Not much later I was on the train to Oxford. It was a bright day, and from the window I gazed at the distant concavities of the landscape, the green swales that dipped away from the tracks and then rose in steep hills to meet the afternoon light. Intermittently I dozed, with the heavy wakefulness of the overnight traveler. Finally in the last half hour of the trip I got some real rest, and woke only when an old woman pushing a cart came through the train. I bought a cup of coffee from her. <br>When we arrived I took a cab to my new college, Fleet; at Oxford every student belongs both to the university and to one of its forty constituent colleges, each its own dominion upon a few acres, with its own library, its own bar, its own chapel. From the cobblestone lane outside the college I looked up and saw its high white spires, and through the tall, black-iron gates a stretch of green grass. I would wait to look around, I thought. <br>Instead I fetched my room key from the porters, a group of men in bowler hats and gray wool suits. The porters&#x2019; lodge lay just inside the gates. (&#x201c;Cheek,&#x201d; said one of them lazily when he had to leave his tea to help me.) From there I turned right down a lane just near the gates and found myself at the Cottages, a row of twelve brick houses, haphazardly rife with ivy, where Fleet&#x2019;s graduate students lived. It was also the corridor that connected the college to the center of the city. <br>My house was the third to last, with a flagstone courtyard before it and a long, slender garden full of fading trees behind. At the door I staggered to a standstill under my bags, panting slightly, then with a last great crash went inside and let everything drop off my shoulders in the entryway. Above me, halfway up the stairs, was another student. <br>&#x201c;You look as if you&#x2019;ve been on a death march,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;I overpacked.&#x201d; <br>He smiled, and we met on the second step to shake hands. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Tom Raleigh. If you&#x2019;re William Baker you&#x2019;re room four, next to me. Anyway I don&#x2019;t imagine you&#x2019;re Anil Gupta, in room two, or Margo Peabody, room one. Let me take some of those bags.&#x201d; <br>Tom was English, tall, thin, and pale, with freckles and bright red lips. Looking at him for the first time I saw a trace of privately educated cruelty in his heavy-eyed expression, of wishes met, small worlds conquered. He picked up three of my bags, and I hauled the rest up the stairs behind him. On the second floor were two doors, and through his I could see half-unpacked boxes and a squat refrigerator. &#x201c;My sister dropped me off this morning,&#x201d; he said. We stopped in front of the heavy oak door just next to his, which was mine. My name was printed on it in gold leaf. <br>He put down my things. &#x201c;Get settled, then knock on my door for a beer if you like. My sister also filled my fridge before she left.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thanks, I will.&#x201d; <br>He hesitated and then grinned. &#x201c;Americans everywhere,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Oxford now, I suppose.&#x201d; <br>I closed the door behind me and called my mother. &#x201c;Hey, it&#x2019;s me. I made it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, my God!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in my room, just got here.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you live in another country! What is it like? What can you see?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not bad.&#x201d; I looked around. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a fireplace, but it has a radiator in it. I have a couple of windows, so I can see the yard. Wait, if I lean out&#x2014;I&#x2019;m leaning out, and I can see the back lawns of Fleet. Just like that picture I showed you online, only they look bigger.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re there! Is it beautiful?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen much.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Can you get the <i>Times</i>?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Mom.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s England, not North Korea.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do you want me to send it to you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t be ridiculous.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re in England! What did Alison say?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m about to call her.&#x201d; <br>After we hung up I lumped down into one of the armchairs by the window&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t face unpacking&#x2014;and looked out. <br>I had a strange, displaced feeling, heightened by fatigue. It was a mystery to me how I had come to be here. Not practically&#x2014;after my last job ended I had sent in an application, a late one, but I was so settled in New York that it had never seemed likely to come to anything. A number of events in the year that preceded my arrival in Oxford had pushed me toward a change, but I might as easily have gone to Shanghai or Bermuda. <br>It was true that I had never felt more at home anywhere than college, and that I missed it. Oxford, specifically, was linked in my mind with a peculiar blended sense of peace and grandeur. I had a weakness for that. This was my first time in England, but it was a country, dangerously, that I had loved for much of my life, especially during the unhappy and turbulent days of my childhood, when I devised a kind of imaginative home there without ever having been, based on the books to which I exiled myself: Sherlock Holmes, Kenneth Grahame, C. S. Lewis. Why had they once made me so happy, I wondered? The calm, the civility, the safety, I suppose&#x2014;lengthening shadows on the cricket pitch, tea at five&#x2014;all of it foolish. There&#x2019;s no lasting safety to life. The only thing that will become of anyone is death. Yet: I felt an exhaling happiness to gaze out at the English sunlight, the English trees. Soon enough I fell asleep again. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>There was a knock on the door thirty or forty minutes later. It was Tom. He took the other armchair, and for a while we talked, feet up on t...</p><h2>Way of the Shaman</h2><p>Way of the Shaman</p><p><p>Michael Harner, Ph.D., has taught anthropology at various institutions, including the University of California at Berkeley, Columbia University, Yale University, and the New School in New York, and has practiced shamanism and shamanic healing since 1961 when he was initiated into Upper Amazonian shamanism.

Over a half century later, the book still offers one of the best available accounts of the ordinary citizens who made up the Confederate army. The Life of Johnny Reb does not merely describe the battles and skirmishes fought by the Confederate foot soldier. Rather, it provides an intimate history of a soldier's daily life -- the songs he sang, the foods he ate, the hopes and fears he experienced, the reasons he fought. Wiley examined countless letters, diaries, newspaper accounts, and official records to construct this frequently poignant, sometimes humorous account of the life of Johnny Reb. In a new foreword for this updated edition, Civil War expert James I. Robertson, Jr., explores the exemplary career of Bell Irvin Wiley, who championed the common folk, whom he saw as ensnared in the great conflict of the 1860s.</p><p>"A fascinating, well-written, stimulating, and valuable book." -- Tennessee Historical Quarterly</p><p>"[Wiley] has painted with skill a picture of the life of the Confederate private... that is not only by far the most complete we have ever had but perhaps the best of its kind we ever shall have." -- Saturday Review of Literature</p><p>Bell Irvin Wiley (1906--1980) was a professor emeritus of history at Emory University and one of America's preeminent Civil War historians.

We have been constrained by unwritten rules not to do so, by the robes of tradition and by the sanctity of our exclusive calling...But I feel it is time to speak out."</i> <p> Celebrated as the most successful geisha of her generation, Mineko Iwasaki was only five years old when she left her parents' home for the world of the geisha. For the next twenty-five years, she would live a life filled with extraordinary professional demands and rich rewards. She would learn the formal customs and language of the geisha, and study the ancient arts of Japanese dance and music. She would enchant kings and princes, captains of industry, and titans of the entertainment world, some of whom would become her dearest friends. Through great pride and determination, she would be hailed as one of the most prized geishas in Japan's history, and one of the last great practitioners of this now fading art form. </p><p> In <i>Geisha, a Life,</i> Mineko Iwasaki tells her story, from her warm early childhood, to her intense yet privileged upbringing in the Iwasaki okiya (household), to her years as a renowned geisha, and finally, to her decision at the age of twenty-nine to retire and marry, a move that would mirror the demise of geisha culture. Mineko brings to life the beauty and wonder of Gion Kobu, a place that "existed in a world apart, a special realm whose mission and identity depended on preserving the time-honored traditions of the past." She illustrates how it coexisted within post-World War II Japan at a time when the country was undergoing its radical transformation from a post-feudal society to a modern one. </p><p> "There is much mystery and misunderstanding about what it means to be a geisha. I hope this story will help explain what it is really like and also serve as a record of this unique component of Japan's cultural history," writes Mineko Iwasaki. <i>Geisha, a Life</i> is the first of its kind, as it delicately unfolds the fabric of a geisha's development. Told with great wisdom and sensitivity, it is a true story of beauty and heroism, and of a time and culture rarely revealed to the Western world.</p></p><p>Now in her 50s, Mineko Iwasaki was one of the most famed geishas of her generation (and the chief informant for Arthur Golden's <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i>). Her ascent was difficult, not merely because of the hard, endless training she had to undergo--learning how to speak a hyper-elevated dialect of Japanese and how to sing and dance gracefully while wearing a 44-pound kimono atop six-inch wooden sandals--but also because many of the elaborate, self-effacing rules of the art went against her grain. A geisha "is an exquisite willow tree who bends to the service of others," she writes. "I have always been stubborn and contrary. And very, very proud." And playful, too: one of the funniest moments in this bittersweet book describes a disastrous encounter with the queen of England and her all-too-interested husband.<p> Revealing the secrets of the geisha's "art of perfection," this graceful memoir documents a disappearing world. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Born in 1949, <b>Mineko Iwasaki</b> began training in the arts of dance and etiquette when she was five years old. Soon after becoming a full-fledged geisha, Mineko was lauded as the star geisha of the Gion Kobu of Kyoto. She held that position until retirement at the age of twenty-nine. Now fifty-two, Mineko has one daughter and lives with her husband in a Kyoto suburb.</p><h2>The Home Front: Germany (World War II Series)</h2><p>The story of two men, one of whom conquered empires, one of whom tackled the drainage problems of a small village.

Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, <i>Urusei Yatsura</i>, was serialized in <i>Weekly Shonen Sunday</i>. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--<b><i>Maison Ikkoku</i></b> ran from 1980 to 1987, <b><i>Ranma</i></b> <b><i>1/2</i></b> from 1987 to 1996, and <b><i>Inuyasha</i></b> from 1996 to 2008.

But such attitudes are relatively recent developments. In <i>The Pun Also Rises</i>, John Pollack-a former World Pun Champion and presidential speechwriter for Bill Clinton-explains why such wordplay is significant: It both revolutionized language and played a pivotal role in making the modern world possible. Skillfully weaving together stories and evidence from history, brain science, pop culture, literature, anthropology, and humor, <i>The Pun Also Rises</i> is an authoritative yet playful exploration of a practice that is common, in one form or another, to virtually every language on earth.</p> <p>At once entertaining and educational, this engaging book answers fundamental questions: Just what is a pun, and why do people make them? How did punning impact the development of human language, and how did that drive creativity and progress?

DK brings unrivalled clarity to a wide range of topics with a unique combination of words and pictures, put together to spectacular effect. We have a reputation for innovation in design for both print and digital products. &nbsp; Our adult range spans travel, including the award-winning DK Eyewitness Travel Guides, history, science, nature, sport, gardening, cookery, and parenting.

DK acts as the parent company for Alpha Books, publisher of the Idiot's Guides series and Prima Games, video gaming publishers, as well as the award-winning travel publisher, Rough Guides.Condensing millions of years of life on earth into a 512-page single-volume encyclopedia, this ambitious work presents earth&#x2019;s history from its formation through the Mesolithic period (Middle Stone Age). Divided into three sections, Prehistoric Life begins with a brief look at &#x201c;Young Earth.&#x201d; Two-page spreads examine topics such as plate tectonics, fossils, and the geological timescale. The bulk of the volume discusses &#x201c;Life on Earth&#x201d; and is divided by era from the Archean through the Quaternary. Each section introduces the plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates (as applicable) representative of that time period. The final section delves into &#x201c;The Rise of the Humans&#x201d; and discusses human relatives, ancestors, origins, and migration patterns. Although a wealth of scientific information is provided, the illustrative material is the star of this volume. The collection of full-color photographs of fossils (ranging from spore to dinosaur) and skeletons show amazing detail and clarity. Visitors to a natural history museum could not explore the number of examples contained here. Where actual photographs are obviously not available, DK commissioned 3-D images, &#x201c;modeled using scientific research&#x201d; to bring life-forms to the page for readers. Photographs and other images are accompanied by information about the creature such as name, group, date, and location. Scaled images (of either a thumb, a hand, or a human) are used to help readers visualize actual sizes. Geared to adults, this work will find popularity with science enthusiasts and browsers alike. Because of the relatively low cost, public libraries will likely want more than one copy. High schools with a strong science program will want to consider purchase for their library or science department. --Shauna Yusko</p><h2>The God I Never Knew Study Guide</h2><p>This eight-week Study Guide is the companion to The God I Never Knew Curriculum Bundle &amp; Study Guide + DVD Sets.

Reluctant to remain in Hungary until either the Nazis or the Soviets took over, he fled at the age of 23 with a forged exit visa and fifty pounds sterling to stave off hunger in Istanbul, Turkey. During his off hours as a dancer, he read some 200 books on the market and the great speculators, spending as much as eight hours a day studying. Darvas invested his money into a couple of stocks that had been hitting their 52-week high. He was utterly surprised that the stocks continued to rise and subsequently sold them to make a large profit. His main source of stock selection was Barron&#39;s Magazine. At the age of 39, after accumulating his fortune, Darvas documented his techniques in the book, How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market. The book describes his unique &#34;Box System&#34;, which he used to buy and sell stocks.

Wafting from the kitchen, the smell of chicken smothered in cream and pepper until it&#x2019;s falling off the bone. I&#x2019;m playing an ancient wind-up record left over from when my father was a boy; &#x201c;K-K-K-Katy&#x201d; crackles in my ear. Through my grandmother&#x2019;s open bedroom door, I glimpse chintz dust ruffles, hatboxes, the slender oval mirror over the dressing table, where she leans, and I see her dab the fluffy puff between her legs.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#x2019;s it: brief cloud of bath powder, grinding consonant K-K-K-Katy (<i>I&#x2019; ll be waiting at the k-k-k-kitchen</i> <i>door</i>), warped light throwing rainbows back through the door. And I wonder, always, why do such fragments remain forever engraved, when, surely, significant ones are lost? The kitchen fragrance, no mystery. For who, ever, could forget Fanny&#x2019;s smothered chicken?<br>&nbsp;<br>An early memory of my father: He opens his buff hunting coat, and in all the small interior pockets, doves&#x2019; heads droop. He and his friends Bascom and Royce break out the bourbon. From my room in the back of the house, right off the kitchen, I see through the keyhole (keyholes are a large part of childhood) the doves he&#x2019;s killed piled on the counter, and someone&#x2019;s hand cleaning a shotgun barrel with a dishrag. The terrible plop-ploop sound of feathers being plucked makes me bury my face under the pillow. When his friends go, my father stays at the table with his tumbler of bourbon. I&#x2019;m reading with a flashlight under the covers. My specialty is orphans on islands where houses have trapdoors into secret passageways that lead to the sea. Rowboats, menace, treasure, and no parents in the story. As the water darkens and danger grows, I hear my father talking to himself. When I quietly crack the door, I see his head in his hands, his bloodstained coat hung on a hook. Very late, he hits the wall with his fist, and says over and over, &#x201c;Beastly, Christly, beastly, Christly.&#x201d; I put the palm of my hand over the spot where he is pounding with his fist and feel the vibration all the way up my arm. I press my nose to the window screen and look out at the still backyard.<br>&nbsp;<br>A tea olive tree grows outside my bedroom window, its scent airy, spicy, and I prefer it to the dizzy perfume of the gardenias and magnolias that rule the neighborhood. Tough ovoid leaves scrape the screen; the tiny flower clusters are fit only for dollhouse bouquets. Then the back door slams and the car screeches out the driveway.<br>&nbsp;<br>My father&#x2019;s parents live two blocks away. I like to gaze into the silver globe under the giant oak in their backyard. My face looks distorted and moony, especially when I cross my eyes and stick out my tongue. In the mirrored sphere, the yard curves back, foregrounded with oak branches like enormous claws. On the latticed back porch, my grandmother Mayes washes a bowl of peaches with her maid, Fanny Brown. Mother Mayes&#x2019;s hair is as silvery as the garden globe, and her crepey skin so white she&#x2019;s almost blue. She looks as though she might dissolve or disappear&#x2014;her pale eyes always seem fixed on somewhere just beyond me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Late in the afternoon, she puts up her bare feet on an ottoman. With the lamp haloing her hair, she&#x2019;s ethereal, but then I see crude, tough yellow corns on the last two toes of each foot. They&#x2019;re translucent in the lamp&#x2019;s glow, as she relaxes with <i>The</i> <i>Upper Room, </i>a church book of devotional reading, open on her lap.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dove heads, tea olive, silver globe, bowl of peaches, church books. Images are the pegs holding down memory&#x2019;s billowing tent. From them, I try to figure out who my people were and where we lived, what they did and what they could have done.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>South Georgia, where I was born, may look to a stranger speeding down I-75 like lonesome country where you can drive for miles without seeing more than a canebrake rattlesnake cross the road. At the city limits of our town a sign said if you lived here you&#x2019;d be home now. The logic is irrefutable. Thin roads shimmering in the heat lead into Fitzgerald from Ocilla, Mystic, Lulaville, Osierfield, Pinetta, Waterloo, Land&#x2019;s Crossing, Bowen&#x2019;s Mill, and Irwinville, where Jefferson Davis was captured by the Yankees. Then, no I-75 existed.<br>&nbsp;<br>To those whose ribs were formed from red clay, the place is complex, exhilarating, charged, various: mighty brown rivers to float along, horizons drawn with an indigo pen, impossibly tall longleaf pines, virulent racism (then, and not all erased now), the heat that makes your heart beat thickly against your chest, the self-satisfaction of those of us who have always lived there, tornadoes twirling in a purple sky, the word &#x201c;repent&#x201d; nailed to trees. A place of continuous contradiction, a box with a false bottom. A black rag doll becomes a white doll when I turn her upside down. I jump onto soft green moss behind the cotton mill and sink into sewage. Daddy in his white suit fishes me out, shouting curses. I&#x2019;m born knowing that the place itself runs through me like rain soaking into sand.<br>We are fabric people, as others are the Miwok people, circus people, lost people. In the cotton mill&#x2014;my father&#x2019;s business&#x2014;the light is gray because lint catches in the screened windows. Oily black machines, gigantic strung looms as beautiful as harps, their shuttles pulled by lean women. Bins to climb and then dive from into piled raw cotton. In the tin cup of the scale over the bin I ride, the needle jerking between fifty and fifty-five pounds, then fly out, the landing not as gentle as I expect. Rayon is softer, and squeaks as I fall in. But to fly, actually, as in dreams. A natural act, as later I would swing out over the spring on vines at night, dropping into cold black water below, crawl up the slippery bank, grabbing roots, then swing out again and again for that moment of falling. Water moccasins, thick as my leg, thirty-pound rockfish with primitive snouts, even crocodiles lived in these deep streams I dove into, pushing my fist into the icy &#x201c;boils,&#x201d; that bubbling force at the bottom.<br>&nbsp;<br>While my father ran the cotton mill and hunted birds, my mother gathered, and created perfect bridge luncheons, with the aid of our cook Willie Bell. The house pulsated with cleanliness. My two sisters were both in college by the time I was eight, but I stayed in my room at the back of the house instead of moving into theirs. Often I riffled through their scrapbooks and high school notebooks in their closet, and tried on their left-behind dresses that had more flounces than mine, and the flowery scent of White Shoulders lingering in the tucks and pleats.<br>&nbsp;<br>I loved the square brick Carnegie library, the quiet that engulfs you as you gently close the door, the globe to spin and stop, with a finger on Brazil or China, the cold light in the high windows in winter, the way the bookcases jut out to make little rooms, my yellow card with due-date stamps, the brass return slot, the desk where presides the librarian, who looks like a large squirrel. Before<br>kindergarten, my sisters showed me the low bookcase<br>for my<br>age. I moved year by year to a different section of the back room.<br>So much later, I may cross the threshold into the main library<br>where I can check out only two, then four books.<br>&nbsp;<br>Other literature was mail order. I never had seen a real book-<br>store. We had Book of the Month. We subscribed to <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i><br><i>Bazaar, </i>for copying dresses, <i>Reader&#x2019;s Digest, </i>required for school,<br>and, for some reason, <i>Arizona Highways</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Fitzgerald, where I might have lived forever, was as rigidly hierarchical as England. We had our aristocracy, with dukes, bar sinisters, jokers, local duchesses in black Cadillacs, many earls, and, of course, ladies, ladies, ladies, many of them always in waiting. Everything and everyone had a place and everything and everyone was in it. It was a cloying, marvelous, mysterious, and obnoxious world, as I later came to know, but fate placed me there and, although the house was not lilting, I was <i>happy as</i> <i>the grass was green.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>We were not normal. We lived next door to normal people, so I knew what normal was. The father worked for the state agriculture department, the mother gave a perm called a &#x201c;Toni&#x201d; to her sisters and friends, and they laughed and had fun as they breathed in ammonia fumes. Their boy sang in the choir, and the daughter, Jeannie, with wild hair, was my playmate.<br>We found house-paint cans in the barn and brushed black and white enamel over each other. Our irate mothers scoured us with kerosene, and Jeannie seemed to be lifted in the jaws of her mother like a kitten and taken home. Her father built a swing set with a pair of rings that we learned to grip, push off into a somersault, vault up on our feet, and hang upside down. On the swings we could pump so high we&#x2019;d almost flip over the top. He took us to farms in his truck and we sat in back eating raw peanuts we&#x2019;d pulled from the ground. They tasted like dirt. Jeannie and I made hideouts in the vacant lot next to her house, elaborate setups of pallets and cardboard boxes, with tin doll dishes and stolen kitchen knives. We sat on a pile of sour grass weed poring over the Sears, Roebuck catalog. <i>What would</i> <i>you choose if you could choose anything on this page? </i>After pelting rains, our walls sagged. On Christmas mornings, she and I ran back and forth between our houses, looking at what Santa left, long before anyone awoke. We strung tin cans with string between our bedrooms, but never could hear a thing. Her mother, Matrel, had lively sisters named Pearl, Ruby, and Jewel. Her uncle always called us &#x201c;Coosaster Jane,&#x201d; which we thought was German he&#x2019;d learned in the war. She called her daddy &#x201c;Pappy.&#x201d; He was strong, redheaded, and sweet. I wonder why I did not envy them. I think small children may have no imagination for a life that is not their own lot.<br>&nbsp;<br>Other families were happy, too. &#x201c;The Greeks&#x201d; were happy even though their daughter Calliope had polio and had to walk with crutches and go to Warm Springs and lie in an iron lung, that awful water heater turned on its side. The Lanes were happy even though the father drove a potato chip truck for endless hours and the delicate mother had a problem so that their bathroom was stacked to the ceiling with sanitary napkin boxes. I was in awe over how they pampered Rose Ann. My best friend, Edna Lula, was the only child in the perfect family. She was doted on and prettily plump; their house had beds with warm dips in the middle like nests, and French doors that opened onto a long porch with a swing. Happy mother and daddy who called her by a nickname left over from baby talk. I could not be at her house enough. There, I fell under their bountiful love. They thought I was funny. They called me by my family nickname, Bud. There was no chink. Ribbon candy always filled the same dish on the sideboard. We licked peach ice cream off the wooden beater, loved pouring the rock salt slush out of the churn. They were admiring, told jokes, hugged; their garden fish pool had a statue of a naked boy, clean water coming out of his thing, landing on the old goldfish in the murk. There was a baby grand piano. My friend plunked out &#x201c;Song of the Volga Boatman,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Blest Be the Tie That Binds.&#x201d; Church not only Sunday morning but the evening service, too. (I drew the line at that.)<br>&nbsp;<br>My mother and her friends laid swatches of fabric over sofas. They carried samples of peach, ivory, teal, and cream paint in their purses. They contemplated the recovered wing chair with the attention surgeons give to incisions. Pale peach is a good color, a lasting color; it never looks as if the chair has just been done. You never want the chair to appear just done. There are fine points: double welting, never tacks except on leather. The act of attention was intense and disciplined. The house must have a sense of itself. Greens and blues will fool you; you don&#x2019;t remember shades as well as you think.<br>&nbsp;<br>My mother wants color and polish and devotion. She wants the linens ironed and the windows clean. Fabric, stitching, tatting, piecing into designs, interfacing for durability and form. Her friend Grace can see a dress on someone in Atlanta, go home, and cut the pattern out of newspaper. The methods are sound: hem by picking up the stitch, doubling back for it then going forward, around a circle, as in writing&#x2014;the piercing bright words, the tension of the thread.<br>&nbsp;<br>The network of women existed in a world as private as purdah. Among themselves, my mother&#x2019;s friends were brutally frank, raucous, and never oblivious to compromise. Talk was of <i>should, </i>of standards, local gossip, and, at least five times a day, of how each person looked. Judging every nuance of appearance was part of our chromosomal makeup. They went out as if disguised by veils. Appearance. And feigned innocence, the vise that keeps women &#x201c;girls&#x201d; well into their sixties.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A generality may have a use, as does a bludgeon, but it obliterates what is of particular use by oversimplifying. Nothing has been dealt this blow so much as the southern woman, black and white. The power behind the throne, iron hand in velvet glove, she endured (what else could she do?), belle of three counties, a little vixen, <i>she&#x2019;s like a member of the family, </i>a great lady, ad infinitum, ad nauseam, and all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding.<br>&nbsp;<br>Every mother I knew could cook like the devil. There&#x2019;s their <i>jouissance, </i>that fine, forgotten-in-English word. Pressed chicken, brown sugar muffins, quail (smothered), Sally Lunn bread, grits with cheese, a spectrum of pies with lemon meringue as the lowest, and black bottom as the epitome. Lane Cake (which no Northerner could ever hope to emulate in this life or the next), and key lime when Mr. Bernhardt got in the Key West limes at his fruit stand. No matter what. Unconditionally, we will cook, from restorative broths to nutmeg custards to grand heroic meals.<br>&nbsp;<br>The splendid matriarchs with power in the open were rare birds. And always endangered. More common is the third-rate power, manipulation. We learned it as we learned cartwheels and the multiplication table. I had my daddy wrapped around my little finger when I was five because I was &#x201c;a pistol,&#x201d; his &#x201c;sweetheart and buddy.&#x201d; We knew Scarlett could get Rhett back. &#x201c;Blink your eyes slowly as you look up at a boy,&#x201d; my mother instructs. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t swim so much.

But even for man who's committed a lifetime of murder, he's more dangerous than ever before. How can Batman protect his city and those he's closest to? It all leads back to Arkham Asylum...<br><br>This new hardcover collects the critically acclaimed tale DEATH OF THE FAMILY from the superstar #1 New York Times best-selling team of writer Scott Snyder and artist Greg Capullo. BATMAN VOLUME 3 will have repercussions that will affect the Batman universe for years to come!<br><br>Collects BATMAN #13-17</p><p><p><b><em>Batman, Vol. 3: Death of the Family</em>: Interview with Scott Snyder by Charlie Chang</b></p> <p><strong>The Joker is arguably the most popular villain in comics and in entertainment. How do you go about tackling such an icon in not only the Joker?</strong></p> <p><strong>Scott Snyder:</strong> For me personally, the only way to write these iconic characters when there&#x2019;s 75 years of great stories that have already been written is to make these stories personal. Assume that if you make it personal, then that&#x2019;s how you make it original. So I came up with the idea for this story when we were about to have our second kid and I just kept finding myself wishing that I could stop worrying about the first kid once in a while and wondering how I was going to do this again. I came to this realization that Batman has this family and he probably thinks that same thing once in a while like, I wish I could stop worrying about them. Then that led me to this idea that someone might ask him, &#x201c;Well why don&#x2019;t you just kill all of them? That would make it easy...&#x201d; and that&#x2019;s the Joker right there. I knew that was the Joker, I could hear it in my head. It was perfect, you hear that and you know he&#x2019;s coming. Then it became a process of trying to develop a story of how to go deeper and deeper and darkly into that idea.</p> <p><strong>Just a few years ago, The Dark Knight film redefined Joker when a lot of people didn&#x2019;t think that would have been possible. What&#x2019;s different about this version?</strong></p> <p><strong>Scott:</strong>I love the Heath Ledger Joker, I also love The Joker from Frank Miller&#x2019;s The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore&#x2019;s Killing Joke, but we tried to create our version that&#x2019;s both funny and almost humorously apocalyptic in his own kind of way while at the same time giving this Joker his own look. In another book (Detective Comics, Vol. 1) his face was cut off and we picked that up because it hadn&#x2019;t been dealt with and we turned it into something for our story where he belts on his own skin-face thing and that&#x2019;s part of the theme of this story where he&#x2019;s trying to say, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s look beneath the skin of this relationship and see what you really look like beneath that mask, all of you, you fools.&#x201d; So in a way, I think this is very different than anything you&#x2019;ve ever seen, especially if you love the Joker, if you&#x2019;re new to comics or new to the character at all, hopefully it&#x2019;s something that gets your attention.</p> <p><strong>If you could put your favorite thing about this book, what would it be?</strong></p> <p><strong>Scott:</strong> The thing that I love about it is how dark it is. I try to write the Joker with integrity and from the perspective that he genuinely believes that he&#x2019;s doing Batman a service by getting him to kill his own family because he believes Batman loves his villains more than his heroes or his allies. Because ultimately what&#x2019;s going to happen is each one of them is going to die or fall to some villain and he&#x2019;ll end up alone with the villains that he keeps alive and doesn&#x2019;t kill anyway. So why not just do it now? The twisted truth, brutality, and relentlessness of that conviction is what I love about this book the most. The Joker believes he&#x2019;s peeling back the face of Batman to show a truth that&#x2019;s there that Batman does not want to admit is beneath the cowl.</p> <p><strong>Some of the other writers writing the tie-ins to Death of the Family have touched on this but coming out of this book, what are you most excited to explore after this big huge epic?</strong></p> <p><strong>Scott:</strong> Well for me, it was never really about what happens in continuity, it was never about the idea that the Bat family isn&#x2019;t going to meet or work together anymore. That was a fun repercussion in the books but it&#x2019;s the first part of a story within a story about the Joker that I plan to continue. Its part of the relationship I&#x2019;m fascinated by and this is only one piece of it. So to me it&#x2019;s really about this part, the Joker saying we love you and you love us so why don&#x2019;t you admit it.</p> <p><strong>This book is so full of rich themes and emotional characters, what do you think is the core of this book and what is Death of the Family really all about?</strong></p> <p><strong>Scott:</strong> This book really is a meditation on the dark and twisted nature of Batman&#x2019;s relationship, both with the Joker and with his own family. How the Joker, as evil and horrifying as he is, sometimes can extrapolate from a kernel of truth, a horrible abomination of that truth that speaks to something that can terrify everybody. That to me is really what this book is about and I&#x2019;m very proud of that.</p>Scott Snyder is the bestselling and award-winning writer of <i>Batman, American Vampire</i> and <i>Swamp Thing</i> as well as the short story collection <i>Voodoo Heart.&nbsp; </i>He teaches writing at Sarah Lawrence College, NYU and Columbia University.

What does a shifting demographic cycle mean? How does the explosive growth of emerging markets matter? Why does the world's population affect my portfolio? Does the global monetary system impact my results this year? How does government intervention in markets impact my strategy? In <i>Pragmatic Capitalism</i>, Cullen Roche explores how our global economy works and why it is more important now than ever for investors to understand macroeconomics. Cullen Roche combines his expertise in global macro portfolio management, quantitative risk management, behavioral finance, and monetary theory to explain to readers how macroeconomics works, and provides insights and suggestions for getting the most out of their investment strategies. This book will uncover market myths and explain the rise of macroeconomics and why it impacts the readers' portfolio construction. <i>Pragmatic Capitalism </i>is a must for any sophisticated investor who wants to make the most of their portfolio.</p><p>Cullen Roche is the founder of Orcam Financial Group, a San Diego based financial consulting firm that works with individual investors and institutions. He previously worked at Merrill Lynch before starting a small investment partnership. He is best known for his work on the Great Recession and having predicted the housing bubble. He is the founder of the popular financial blog "Pragmatic Capitalism," which feeds through to <i>Seeking Alpha. </i>He is regularly cited in <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>and the <i>Financial Times.</i>Roche, financial consultant and blogger, aims to offer a sensible framework for considering money, finance, and economics in our interconnected macroeconomic world and presents his principles and understandings of the global financial system to help us invest, save, and participate within this changing system. The author explains the new macroeconomy and how it is changing portfolios, including commentary on understanding risk, setting realistic goals, having realistic expectations, and learning important guidelines for picking active managers. He defines the field of behavioral finance as &#x201c;the study of understanding the economy through the psychologically driven actions of its participants.&#x201d; Learning about ourselves and how we and others think is important preparation for participants, and our worst enemy in the financial world can be our human emotions. Roche shares lessons from his investing experience, which are never let emotions drive your decision-making process, never participate in what you don&#x2019;t understand, mistakes will be made and always learn from them, and hope is not a strategy. This challenging, thought-provoking book offers valuable information. --Mary Whaley</p><h2>Madame Maigret&#39;s Friend (Inspector Maigret)</h2><p><b><b><b><b>&#x201c;One of the greatest writers of the twentieth century . . .

Since earning a doctorate in clinical psychology, he has conducted research on the psychometric evaluation of cognitive abilities, child clinical assessment, structural equation modeling, training of behavioral science researchers, and usability engineering in computer science. Dr. Kline has published five books, six chapters, and more than 40 articles in research journals.</p><br>"I would strongly recommend this book for use as a primary text in any SEM course. It offers a clear, applied presentation of complicated SEM techniques for a wide array of audiences with various abilities. The text would be beneficial for students with a limited background in theoretical statistics, as well as those with a strong understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of SEM. I often refer to this text in my everyday work, due to the clarity with which the material is presented."--Greg Welch, PhD, Nebraska Center for Research on Children, Youth, Families, and Schools, University of Nebraska-Lincoln<br><br>"The skill and knowledge sets for evaluating and using SEM have become important components of social science education. Kline provides a text that is accessible for graduate students, practitioners, and researchers who are not intimately familiar with SEM techniques. In addition, he effortlessly summarizes current information that researchers who already use SEM should have. The reorganization of the material, new topic boxes, new Web page, and updated technical information enhance an already great resource. A major strength of the book is the individual chapter examples with explanation of the values provided from a variety of statistical analysis packages. I will continue to use this third edition as the primary text in my SEM course, and highly recommend it as both a text and a technical resource."--James B. Schreiber, PhD, Center for Advancing the Study of Teaching and Learning, Duquesne University&nbsp;<br><br>"In the third edition, Kline has improved the pedagogical value of his book relative to prior editions and to other SEM books. The many exercises help a reader understand how to apply important chapter concepts, making the book not only useful for an SEM course, but also an effective resource for self-study. The Web page featuring complete computer syntax and data for the examples is very helpful. Other new material further supports a reader&#x2019;s understanding of SEM; for example, Chapter 2 provides more information on multiple regression/correlation, and the chapter on data preparation has been expanded to cover important topics such as positive-definite matrices, which are among the most common problems researchers experience when using SEM. This edition also provides more information on available SEM software, including an entire chapter on the use of computer software."--Craig Wells, PhD, School of Education, University of Massachusetts-Amherst&nbsp;"Chapters 2 and 3 review important concepts in multiple regression and data screening, both of which are critical to understand before learning SEM. From an instructor's perspective, I enjoyed reading these chapters very much. They are well written, logically organized, and easy to follow. Another strength of the book is the thorough and comprehensive reference list on various topics."--Duan Zhang, PhD, College of Education, University of Denver&nbsp;"I am excited about this book. The coverage is excellent and the writing style is friendly and direct, with a subtle humor that I find refreshing. I especially like the new topic boxes in the third edition, most of which discuss issues that I have had to address separately in lectures."--Jacob Marszalek, PhD, Division of Counseling and Educational Psychology, University of Missouri-Kansas City &nbsp;"If you didn't think a statistics text could be riveting, read this book! The first chapter covers basic statistical concepts in better detail and more clearly than other texts that are meant to be general introductions. Discussing extremely helpful articles that have examined SEM research, Kline identifies and provides empirical evidence of potential problems with using and reporting SEM. This helps readers understand what to do (and what not to do) from the very beginning. I love it that one of the goals is to help readers avoid common mistakes in SEM."--Debbie Hahs-Vaughn, PhD, Department of Educational Research, Technology, and Leadership, University of Central Florida &nbsp;"This is now the #1 book I will recommend to students and substantive researchers (who are not quantitative specialists) who want to learn SEM! Compared to most SEM books that I have seen, this one strikes a better balance between accessibility and breadth. In the third edition, Kline not only has updated the material, but has substantially improved it. He adds more depth to certain topics--such as estimation, in Chapter 7--and covers some intermediate-to-advanced topics not described in the previous edition, all at a level appropriate for beginners."--Noel A. Card, PhD, Division of Family Studies and Human Development, University of Arizona&nbsp;"A terrific introduction to SEM. Kline offers some of the basics and does so in a way that is quite approachable for students. I have recommended this text to a number of people who were just beginning to use SEM, and will continue to do so."--R. Lance Holbert, PhD, School of Communications, Ohio State University <p></p>"Of all the introductory SEM texts, this one is the most interesting to read. Anyone who has taken a course in basic algebra or introductory statistics will be able to understand the ideas and work through the exercises, and those who work their way through the book will have a good foundation in SEM and will be able to use it effectively."--David F.

After marrying in 1970, they moved to California, where Terry earned her doctorate in marine ecology at the University of Southern California and Gerry earned his doctorate in neurobiology at the California Institute of Technology. As postdoctoral students at the University of Washington&#39;s marine laboratories, they worked together on the neural bases of behavior, using a marine mollusk as a model system. Terry and Gerry are now professors of biology at the University of Colorado at Denver, where they have taught introductory biology and neurobiology since 1982. In their research lab, funded by the National Institutes of Health, they investigate the mechanisms by which neurons are harmed by low levels of environmental pollutants. Terry and Gerry share a deep appreciation of nature and of the outdoors. They enjoy hiking in the Rockies, running near their home in the foothills west of Denver, and attempting to garden at 7000 feet in the presence of hungry deer and elk. They are long-time members of many conservation organizations. Their daughter, Heather, has added another focus to their lives. &#34;Bruce E.

David Macaulay&#39;s first book, CATHEDRAL, introduced readers around the world to his unique gift for presenting architecture and technology in simple terms, and for demystifying even the most complex of concepts. CATHEDRAL received a Caldecott Honor Medal and is now considered a classic. BUILDING THE BOOK CATHEDRAL includes the content of CATHEDRAL in its entirety. Here Macaulay traces the evolution of his creative process in &#34;building&#34; that first book, from the initial concept to the finished drawings. He introduces the basic elements of structure and sequence and explains why one angle of a drawing may be better for conveying an idea than another. He describes how perspective, scale, and contrast can be used to connect a reader with concepts, and how placement of a picture on a page can make a difference in the way information is communicated. Building the Book Cathedral provides an opportunity to examine Macaulay&#39;s unique problem-solving skills as he looks back over two and a half decades at the book that launched his distinguished career.</p><p>David Macaulay is an award-winning author and illustrator whose books have sold millions of copies in the United States alone, and his work has been translated into a dozen languages. Macaulay has garnered numerous awards including the Caldecott Medal and Honor Awards, the Boston Globe&#x2013;Horn Book Award, the Christopher Award, an American Institute of Architects Medal, and the Washington Post&#x2013;Children&#x2019;s Book Guild Nonfiction Award. In 2006, he was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, given &#x201c;to encourage people of outstanding talent to pursue their own creative, intellectual, and professional inclinations.&#x201d; Superb design, magnificent illustrations, and clearly presented information distinguish all of his books. David Macaulay lives with his family in Vermont.On its twenty-fifth anniversary, the author recounts the origins of his first book and suggests revisions he'd make in light of what he's learned ("the drawings for Cathedral were among my first serious attempts at working with pen and ink. They are understandably timid," he confides). Indeed, seeing how this Caldecott winner would alter a perennial favorite is as fascinating as becoming privy to its origins. Most of the original Cathedral: The Story of Its Construction is reproduced in this oversize celebratory volume, along with lots of preliminary sketches, new commentary, and revised, or newly deployed, art. Page design is improved with different cropping; drama and coherence are enhanced by new placement on the spread; size is changed for emphasis and variety; a bird's-eye view of the choir is rotated for a more vertiginous effect. There are also minor revisions of text and art for clarity, plus some rueful admissions (handsome as the shafts of light on page 109 may be, the sun could never shine into the nave from the north; the rope would go around the axle of the huge weight-lifting wheel, not circle its circumference-a gaffe duly corrected after the first edition, but "the scale of the bucket is still wrong. It looks like a medieval hot tub"). Such touches of informal humor further enliven a book that's already mesmerizing for both its original content and its insights into this author-illustrator's incisive, ebulliently creative mind.<br>Horn Book<br><br>Everyone who enjoys learning about the mysterious inner workings of anything, and particularly everyone interested in the creative process, will find this semi-confessional and somewhat instructional volume engrossing. The New York Times</p><h2>Impounded: Dorothea Lange and the Censored Images of Japanese American Internment</h2><p><p><strong>Censored by the U.S. Army, Dorothea Lange's unseen photographs are the extraordinary photographic record of the Japanese American internment saga.</strong></p> This indelible work of visual and social history confirms Dorothea Lange's stature as one of the twentieth century's greatest American photographers. Presenting 119 images originally censored by the U.S. Army&#x2015;the majority of which have never been published&#x2015;<em>Impounded</em> evokes the horror of a community uprooted in the early 1940s and the stark reality of the internment camps. With poignancy and sage insight, nationally known historians Linda Gordon and Gary Okihiro illuminate the saga of Japanese American internment: from life before Executive Order 9066 to the abrupt roundups and the marginal existence in the bleak, sandswept camps. In the tradition of Roman Vishniac's <em>A Vanished World, Impounded</em>, with the immediacy of its photographs, tells the story of the thousands of lives unalterably shattered by racial hatred brought on by the passions of war.</p><p><p><strong>Linda Gordon</strong>, winner of two Bancroft Prizes and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Prize, is the author of <em>The Second Coming of the KKK</em>, <em>Dorothea Lange</em> and <em>Impounded</em>, and the coauthor of <em>Feminism Unfinished</em>. She is the Florence Kelley Professor of History at New York University and lives in New York and Madison, Wisconsin.</p><p><strong>Gary Y. Okihiro</strong> is the author of <em>Whispered Silences: Japanese Americans and World War II</em> and <em>Common Ground: Reimagining American History</em>. He is a professor at Columbia University and lives in New York City.</p>When America's War Relocation Authority hired Dorothea Lange to photograph the internment of Japanese-Americans in 1942, they put a few restrictions on her work. Barbed wire, watchtowers and armed soldiers were off limits, they declared. And no pictures of resistance, either. They wanted the roundup and sequestering of Japanese-Americans documented&#x2014;but not too well. Working within these limits, Lange, who is best known for her photographs of migrant farmers during the Depression, nonetheless produced images whose content so opposed the federal objective of demonizing Japanese-Americans that the vast majority of the photographs were suppressed throughout WWII (97% of them have never been published at all). Editors Gordon and Okihiro set this first collection of Lange's internment work within technical, cultural and historical contexts. Gordon (<i>The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction</i>) discusses Lange's professional methods and the formation of her "democratic-populist" beliefs. Okihiro (<i>Whispered Silences: Japanese Americans and World War II</i>) traces the history of prejudice against Japanese Americans, with emphasis on internees' firsthand accounts. But the bulk of the book is given over to Lange's photographs. Several of these are as powerful as her most stirring work, and the final image&#x2014;of a grandfather in the desolate Manzanar Center looking down in anguish at the grandson between his knees&#x2014;is worth the price of the book alone. 104 photos, 2 maps. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The nearly forty essays collected here comprise a unique guidebook to the American landscape after the millennium&#x2015;not just the deserts, skies, gardens, and wilderness areas that have long made up Solnit&#x2019;s subject matter, but the social landscape of democracy and repression, of borders, ruins, and protests. She ventures into territories as dark as prison and as sublime as a broad vista, revealing beauty in the harshest landscape and political struggle in the most apparently serene view. Her introduction sets the tone and the book&#x2019;s overarching themes as she describes Thoreau, leaving the jail cell where he had been confined for refusing to pay war taxes and proceeding directly to his favorite huckleberry patch. In this way she links pleasure to politics, brilliantly demonstrating that the path to paradise has often run through prison.<br><br>These startling insights on current affairs, politics, culture, and history, always expressed in Solnit&#x2019;s pellucid and graceful prose, constantly revise our views of the otherwise ordinary and familiar.

This eagerly anticipated third and final volume of Reiner Stach's definitive biography of the writer answers that question with more facts and insight than ever before, describing the complex personal, political, and cultural circumstances that shaped the young Franz Kafka (1883&#x2013;1924). It tells the story of the years from his birth in Prague to the beginning of his professional and literary career in 1910, taking the reader up to just before the breakthrough that resulted in his first masterpieces, including "The Metamorphosis." Brimming with vivid and often startling details, Stach&#x2019;s narrative invites readers deep inside this neglected period of Kafka&#x2019;s life. The book&#x2019;s richly atmospheric portrait of his German Jewish merchant family and his education, psychological development, and sexual maturation draws on numerous sources, some still unpublished, including family letters, schoolmates&#x2019; memoirs, and early diaries of his close friend Max Brod.</p><br><p>The biography also provides a colorful panorama of Kafka&#x2019;s wider world, especially the convoluted politics and culture of Prague. Before World War I, Kafka lived in a society at the threshold of modernity but torn by conflict, and Stach provides poignant details of how the adolescent Kafka witnessed violent outbreaks of anti-Semitism and nationalism. The reader also learns how he developed a passionate interest in new technologies, particularly movies and airplanes, and why another interest&#x2015;his predilection for the back-to-nature movement&#x2015;stemmed from his &#x201c;nervous&#x201d; surroundings rather than personal eccentricity.</p><br><p>The crowning volume to a masterly biography, this is an unmatched account of how a boy who grew up in an old Central European monarchy became a writer who helped create modern literature.</p></p><p><p>Advance praise for <i>Kafka: The Early Years</i>: "<i>Kafka: The Early Years</i> completes a masterful trilogy. One feature puts it at light-years' distance of superiority to anything previously written about Kafka's early years: Stach had unique access to Max Brod's notebooks, part of a celebrated cache of documents bearing on his friendship with Kafka. Far more fully than any other Kafka biographer, Stach gives us what Hegel calls &#x2018;the concrete vitality of the full individual.' "<b>--Stanley Corngold, author of <i>Lambent Traces: Franz Kafka</i></b></p><p>Advance praise for <i>Kafka: The Early Years</i>: "<i>Kafka: The Early Years</i> is a remarkable conclusion to a momentous biography. It covers what is in many ways the most important and interesting period of Kafka's life, for these are the years during which he was shaped by the world around him and when his character emerged. This is an entertaining, informative account that has no equivalent among the many previous biographies of Kafka."<b>--Mark M. Anderson, author of <i>Kafka's Clothes</i></b></p><b>Reiner Stach</b> worked extensively on the definitive edition of Kafka's collected works before embarking on his three-volume biography of the writer. The other volumes are <i>Kafka: The Decisive Years</i> and <i>Kafka: The Years of Insight</i> (both Princeton). <b>Shelley Frisch's</b> translations of those volumes were awarded the Modern Language Association's Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize and the Helen and Kurt Wolff Translator's Prize.

Each situation/topic-based lesson of the main texts consists of two or three model dialogues, narration, new words and expressions, pronunciation notes, vocabulary notes, culture, grammar, task/function, and English translation of dialogues. The workbooks provide students with extensive skill-using activities based on the skills learned from the main texts. Integrated Korean is a project of the Korean Language Education and Research Center (KLEAR) with the support of the Korea Foundation. In addition to the four-level textbooks and workbooks, forthcoming volumes include instructor&#39;s manuals, Chinese Character Studies, Korean Composition, Selected Readings in Korean, Readings in Modern Korean Literature, Korean Language in Culture and Society, and A Dictionary of Korean Grammar and Usage.</p><p>The accompanying set of 7 audio CDs are available from UH Press for $195.

Prompted by the prophecies of three mysterious witches and goaded by his ambitious wife, the Scottish thane Macbeth murders Duncan, King of Scotland, in order to succeed him on the throne. This foul deed soon entangles the conscience-stricken nobleman in a web of treachery, deceit, and more murders, which ultimately spells his doom. Set amid the gloomy castles and lonely heaths of medieval Scotland, <i>Macbeth</i> paints a striking dramatic portrait of a man of honor and integrity destroyed by a fatal character flaw and the tortures of a guilty imagination.</p>William Shakespeare was born in April 1564 in the town of Stratford-upon-Avon, on England&#x2019;s Avon River. When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.<br><br>Barbara A.

The first battles went badly, and now as Earth prepares to defend itself against the imminent threat of total destruction at the hands of an inscrutable alien enemy, all focus is on the development and training of military geniuses who can fight such a war, and win.</p><p>The long distances of interstellar space have given hope to the defenders of Earth--they have time to train these future commanders up from childhood, forging then into an irresistible force in the high orbital facility called the Battle School.</p><p>Andrew "Ender" Wiggin was not the only child in the Battle School; he was just the best of the best. In this new book, card tells the story of another of those precocious generals, the one they called Bean--the one who became Ender's right hand, part of his team, in the final battle against the Buggers.</p><p>Bean's past was a battle just to survive. He first appeared on the streets of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else's. He knew he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain acceptance into a children's gang, and then to help make that gang a template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to grow older.</p><p>Bean's desperate struggle to live, and his success, brought him to the attention of the Battle School's recruiters, those people scouring the planet for leaders, tacticians, and generals to save Earth from the threat of alien invasion.

By "parallel," Card means that <i>Shadow</i> begins and ends at roughly the same time as <i>Game</i>, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. <p> Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of <i>Shadow</i>, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.</p><p> Although it may seem like <i>Shadow</i> is merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous <i>Ender's Game</i>, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of <i>Ender's Game</i> hinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, <i>Shadow</i> manages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that <i>Shadow</i>, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. <i>--Craig E.

All too often, to our bewilderment, our sincere offers of help are resented, resisted, or refused&#x2014;and we often react the same way when people try to help us. Why is it so difficult to provide or accept help? How can we make the whole process easier? <br><br> In this seminal book on the topic, corporate culture and organizational development guru Ed Schein analyzes the social and psychological dynamics common to all types of helping relationships, explains why help is often not helpful, and shows what any would-be helpers must do to ensure that their assistance is both welcomed and genuinely useful. <br><br> The moment of asking for and offering help is a delicate and complex one, fraught with inequities and ambiguities. Schein helps us navigate that moment so we avoid potential pitfalls, mitigate power imbalances, and establish a solid foundation of trust. He identifies three roles a helper can play, explaining which one is nearly always the best starting point if we are to provide truly effective help. So that readers can determine exactly what kind of help is needed, he describes an inquiry process that puts the helper and the recipient on an equal footing. These dynamics not only apply to all kinds of one-on-one helping in personal and professional relationships, teaching, social work, and medicine but also can be usefully applied to teamwork and to organizational leadership.<br><br> Using examples from many types of relationships&#x2014;doctors and patients, consultants and clients, husbands and wives&#x2014;Ed Schein offers a concise, definitive analysis of what it takes to establish successful, mutually satisfying helping relationships.</p><p>Ed Schein was educated at the University of Chicago, Stanford University (where he received a master&#x2019;s degree in psychology in 1949), and Harvard University (where he received his Ph.D. in social psychology in 1952). He has taught at the MIT Sloan School of Management since 1956 and was named the Sloan Fellows Professor of Management in 1978. He is currently professor emeritus. He is the author of many articles and books, most recently Process Consultation Revisited (1999), The Corporate Culture Survival Guide (1999), and DEC Is Dead: Long Live DEC (2003). His book Organizational Culture and Leadership, 3rd ed. (2004) has defined the field of organizational culture. He has consulted with many organizations in the United States and overseas on organizational culture, organization development, process consultation, and career dynamics. What has distinguished Schein&#x2019;s work is his combination of sociology, anthropology, and social psychology, as illustrated in this book.Helpful and Unhelpful Help<br><br> Helping is a complex phenomenon. There&#x2019;s helpful help and unhelpful help. This book is written to shed light on the difference between the two. In my career as a professor and sometimes consultant I often reflect on what is helpful and what is not, why some classes go well and others do not, why coaching and experiential learning are often more successful than formal lectures. When I am with organizational clients, why does it work better to focus on process rather than content, or how things are done rather than what is done? My goal in this book is to provide the reader with enough insight to be able to actually help when help is asked for or needed, and to be able to receive help when help is needed and offered. Neither is as easy as we often wish.<br><br> The other day, for example, a friend asked me for some advice on how to deal with a problem he was having with his wife. I offered a suggestion to which he replied huffily that not only had he already tried that and it didn&#x2019;t work, but he also implied that I was insensitive to have even made that suggestion. It reminded me of many other situations I have witnessed where help was asked for or offered but the result felt unsuccessful and uncomfortable.<br><br> Then I was reminded of a case of helpful help. Outside my house a woman in her car drove up and asked me, &#x201c;How do I get to Massachusetts Ave.?&#x201d; I asked her where she was headed and learned that she wanted to go to downtown Boston. I then pointed out that the road she was on led directly to downtown and she did not need Mass. Ave. She thanked me profusely for not sending her to the street she had asked for.<br><br> The most common version of unhelpful help that I have experienced as both helper and client concerns the computer. When I call the help line I often don&#x2019;t even understand the diagnostic questions that the helper asks me in order to determine what help I need. When my computer coach tells me the several steps I need to take to solve the problem, I don&#x2019;t know how to interrupt to say, &#x201c;Wait, I don&#x2019;t understand the first step.&#x201d; On the other hand, another computer coach I hired asked me what my personal goals were in learning to use the computer, elicited my desire to use it primarily for writing, and then showed me all the programs and tools that would make writing easier. That felt great. Yet when my wife asks me for help with the computer, I routinely fall into the same trap of telling her what I would do, which turns out to be more than she can handle, and we both end up frustrated.<br><br> Friends, editors, consultants, teachers, and coaches have often made suggestions and proposals that were quite irrelevant to my problem at the time. Even when I ignored them as gently as I could, my sometimes self-appointed helpers reminded me in an irritated tone that they were only trying to be helpful, implying that I was wrong in some way not to have been able to accept the help.<br><br> I remember one of my children asking me for help with her math homework. I interrupted my work, did the problem for her, only to find her sulking off without a thank you. What had I done wrong? On another occasion a child asked for homework help and I said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk. . . .&#x201d; I discovered that she wanted to talk about some serious social problems at school that had nothing to do with homework. We had a good talk and both felt better.<br><br> Doctors, therapists, social workers, and coaches of all sorts have had the experience of the best-intended help going wrong somehow. As a consultant and career coach to managers in various kinds of organizations, I have often figured out solutions to problems that they posed, and only later discovered that either my advice did not work or the client could not or would not implement what I had suggested. I also remember in my own consulting how often it happened that when I intervened to point out some dysfunctional behavior in a group meeting, I was thanked for being very helpful, only to find that the behavior did not change one iota.<br><br> Help is, of course, not limited to the one-on-one situation. Group effort and teamwork often hinge on the degree to which members perform their roles properly in accomplishing the group&#x2019;s task. We do not typically think of an effective team as being a group of people who really know how to help each other in the performance of a task, yet that is precisely what good teamwork is&#x2014;successful reciprocal help. It is interesting to note, however, that the word &#x201c;help&#x201d; is only used in relation to teamwork when it does not occur, as when one group member says to another, &#x201c;What you did was not helpful&#x201d; or &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you help more?&#x201d;<br><br> Helping in a team context is most obvious in team sports, where the ability of one player to score is entirely dependent on the skill of others to pass or block. There are many football stories of successful runners taking their linemen out to dinner after a successful game in acknowledgment of their support. Failure to help in this regard becomes obvious when the quarterback is sacked or the runner is tackled behind the line.<br><br> Clearly, there is more to helping or being helped than meets the eye. This seemingly common and very necessary human process is, in fact, fraught with difficulty and often does not succeed. This book starts with the premise that help is an important but complicated human process. I examine what it really means to help or be helped; what psychological, social, and cultural traps are inherent in this process; and how one can avoid them. As the examples above show, help refers to many things other than the professional help we expect from doctors, lawyers, ministers and social workers. So what is it all about and how do we ensure that it works?<br><br> The Multiple Meanings of Help<br><br> Helping is a very broad concept ranging all the way from the knight in shining armor rescuing the maiden before she is eaten by the dragon to the consultant working with an organization to change its culture to meet new strategic objectives or to improve its performance. From a client perspective, help includes not only what we ask for, but also the spontaneous and generous behavior of others who recognize when we need help even if we have not asked for it.<br><br> Consider the many life situations in which helping of some sort is involved (see Table 1.1). It occurs all the time in both formal and informal situations, and many of the roles described in Table 1.1 are ones we are called on to play ourselves at various times in our lives. To go one step further, helping is intrinsic to all forms of organization and work, because, by definition, we organize because we cannot do the whole job ourselves. Hired help truly refers not only to servants and caretakers, but applies equally to all organizational employees hired to do a specific job that we cannot do ourselves. Fulfilling one&#x2019;s duties in a job is, therefore, also a routine way in which we help. Consider the tensions that arise between supervisors and subordinates when either the subordinate did not put forth the effort to complete the task or the boss did not provide the time or other resources to get the job done. Workers and their bosses have a sort of psychological contract based on what kind of help they can expect from each other.<br><br> TABLE 1.1 The Many Forms of Help<br><br> The stranger giving the tourist directions<br><br> The parent doing the child&#x2019;s homework<br><br> The spouse advising on what to wear for the party<br><br> The nurse assisting a patient with the bedpan<br><br> The friend supplying a word that is on the tip of your tongue<br><br> The guest offering to clear and do the dishes<br><br> The teacher explaining a concept to a student<br><br> The computer expert walking you through steps to fix a computer problem<br><br> The 911-hotline operator or suicide hotline operator advising someone in distress<br><br> The child showing a friend or parent how to use a new phone or video game<br><br> The coach showing the client how to improve some skill<br><br> The operating-room nurse handing the surgeon the right instrument just in time<br><br> The blocker creating a hole for the runner to run through<br><br> The executive coach advising a manager on how to handle subordinates<br><br> The improvisation team member setting up his/her partner to deliver the punch line and get the laugh<br><br> The counselor assisting a laid-off worker to find a new job/career<br><br> The boss advising subordinates how to do their job better<br><br> The assembly line worker putting his or her part in on time so that the line can move on<br><br> The caregiver ministering to a sick person<br><br> The lawyer advising and instructing the client on how to manage a divorce<br><br> The social worker suggesting how a family can cope with an economic crisis<br><br> The psychotherapist working with the client to cope with behavior problems or emotional difficulties<br><br> The minister showing a parishioner how to cope with guilt, grief or anxiety<br><br> The doctor diagnosing a patient and providing a prescription<br><br> The funeral director helping the grieving family cope with death<br><br> The consultant trying to improve the functioning of an organization<br><br> To illustrate further the extensive nature of this concept, note how many different words we use that mean to help in some way (see Table 1.2). Is there anything that all of these helping processes have in common? Is there an underlying cultural meaning that both helpers and clients need to understand better to improve the quality of help offered, given, asked for, and received? With the various kinds of help that exist&#x2014;physical help, emotional support, information, diagnostic insight, advice and recommendations&#x2014;do they need to be distinguished? How are they similar or different?<br><br> TABLE 1.2 The Many Words for Helping<br><br> Image<br><br> Formal and Informal Help<br><br> In the routine of daily life, help is the action of one person that enables another person to solve a problem, to accomplish something, or to make something easier. The person being helped might or might not have been able to do it alone, but helping implies that the task was made easier somehow, or, in the extreme, that it was accomplished at all (as when we save a drowning person). Help is thus the process that underlies cooperation, collaboration, and many forms of altruistic behavior. I will call this category &#x201c;informal&#x201d; help. In all cultures, this form of help is institutionalized and taken for granted as a basis for civilized society. It probably has some biological genetic basis since we know that non-human species engage in this behavior as well. Helping is part of what we think of as manners, rules of civilized behavior, and ethical and moral behavior. Such helping occurs all the time in a routine fashion. Note also that a request or offer of help cannot be ignored&#x2014;it has to be dealt with in some fashion or the social fabric is torn a little and the actors are embarrassed.<br><br> The next level of help can be thought of as &#x201c;semi-formal,&#x201d; where we go to technicians of various sorts to get help with our houses, cars, computers, and audio-visual equipment. Here we require help in making something work, are less involved personally, and pay for the service or information. Many of our most frustrating experiences both as clients and helpers occur in this domain because of our expectation that things should be easy to use and our unwillingness to adapt to new languages and routines such as those required by computers.<br><br> &#x201c;Formal&#x201d; help is needed when we are in some kind of personal, health, or emotional difficulty and need medical, legal, or spiritual assistance from someone licensed to provide such assistance. We go to doctors, lawyers, priests, counselors, social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists for individual attention. When in our managerial and organizational roles we have problems of governance and organizational performance, we go to consultants of various sorts. In these cases the help comes from professionals and is a more formal process that implies contracts, timetables, and the exchange of money or other valuables for services. Most analyses of help deal with this formal level, yet informal and semi-formal help are far more common and often have greater consequences if not given or received effectively.<br><br> We will consider whether the help that occurs in more formal situations is different from the day-to-day informal and semi-formal help. What do effective trained and licensed helpers do that makes them more or less successful, and what can we learn from them to enhance our skills in less formal settings? Equally relevant is to ask what the trained helper can learn from a closer examination of the dynamics of informal and semi-formal help.<br><br> Helping Is a Social Process<br><br> Helping involves more than one person, so I will concentrate on how to think about and define the helping relationship. That focus will, in turn, lead us to a discussion of what is involved in any relationship and what it means to have a good relationship, one in which we can trust each other and can communicate openly.<br><br> All relationships are governed by cultural rules that tell us how to behave in relation to each other so that social intercourse is safe and productive. We call this good manners, tact, or etiquette. Underneath this surface level of overt behavior lie powerful rules that must be followed for society to work at all. Some of these rules vary according to the situation, but in any given culture there will be a set of universal rules that, if violated, cause the person to be ostracized or isolated. When they are violated in an ongoing interaction we become offended, embarrassed, or suspicious that the relationship is not good. This may result in a lack of trust or hurt feelings if the client felt that no help was provided, or the helper felt refused or ignored.<br><br> Though helping is a relationship, the process of offering, giving, or receiving semi-formal or formal help usually starts with individual initiative. What we must understand, then, is how the initial contact between the potential helper and potential client evolves into a relationship that produces help. Someone decides to give or offer help, and that action may lead to a helping relationship; or someone may ask for help, which could also result in a helping relationship. A team leader brings together a bunch of people and creates a relationship-building process that leads to mutual helping among team members. A consultant helps a manager organize different units so that they can help each other in achieving organizational tasks. Sometimes a group or community recognizes that it collectively needs help, but someone must articulate the need and bring it to public consciousness. A relational helping process can then be created.<br><br> The first thing to focus on, therefore, is how personal initiative leads to a relationship. If we understand the dynamics of building any relationship, we can build a more effective helping relationship.<br><br> In the next chapters I will examine what some of the ultimate rules are that govern relationships and how they apply to helping relationships. We will examine the inequities and role ambiguities of helping relationships, the different roles that helpers can take once the relationship is balanced and comfortable, how to build such a relationship, and how to intervene as the client/helper relationship evolves.</p><h2>The Line of Beauty</h2><p><p>In the summer of 1983, twenty-year-old Nick Guest moves into an attic room in the Notting Hill home of the Feddens: conservative Member of Parliament Gerald, his wealthy wife Rachel, and their two children, Toby-whom Nick had idolized at Oxford-and Catherine, highly critical of her family's assumptions and ambitions. </p><p>As the boom years of the eighties unfold, Nick, an innocent in the world of politics and money, finds his life altered by the rising fortunes of this glamorous family.

His parents abandoned him at the age of two, and he lived with his grandmother for several years before being placed in an orphanage. A runaway at age thirteen, Baca was sentenced to five years in a maximum security prison at the age of twenty-one for drug offenses. It was in prison that he learned to read and write and began to compose poetry. His book Mart�n &amp; Meditations on the South Valley, a pair of long narrative poems, won an American Book Award in 1988. In addition to his poetry collections and stories, Baca wrote the screenplay for the movie Bound by Honor, which was released by Hollywood Pictures in 1993.</p><h2>The Eclogues; And, Georgics (Oxford World&#39;s Classics (Paperback))</h2><p>The Eclogues, ten short pastoral poems, were composed between approximately 42 and 39 BC, during the time of the &#39;Second&#39; Triumvirate of Lepidus, Anthony, and Octavian. In them Virgil subtly blended an idealized Arcadia with contemporary history. To his Greek model - the Idylls of Theocritus - he added a strong element of Italian realism: places and people, real or disguised, and contemporary events are introduced. The Eclogues display all Virgil&#39;s art and charm and are among his most delightful achievements. Between approximately 39 and 29 BC, years of civil strife between Antony, and Octavian, Virgil was engaged upon the Georgics. Part agricultural manual, full of observations of animals and nature, they deal with the farmer&#39;s life and give it powerful allegorical meaning. These four books contain some of Virgil&#39;s finest descriptive writing and are generally held to be his greatest and most entertaining work, and C. Day Lewis&#39;s lyrical translations are classics in their own right.</p><p>Virgil (70 BC - 19 BC) was a classical Roman poet. His three major works are the Bucolics (or Eclogues), the Georgics and the Aeneid, although several minor poems are also attributed to him.

Briggs, translation by Constance Garnett. In 1869 a young Russian was strangled, shot through the head and thrown into a pond. His crime? A wish to leave small group of violent revolutionaries, from which he had become alienated. Dostoevsky takes this real-life catastrophe as the subject and culmination of Devils, a title that refers the young radicals themselves and also to the materialistic ideas that possessed the minds of many thinking people Russian society at the time. The satirical portraits of the revolutionaries, with their naivety, ludicrous single-mindedness and readiness for murder and destruction, might seem exaggerated - until we consider their all-too-recognisable descendants in the real world ever since. The key figure in the novel, however, is beyond politics. Nikolay Stavrogin, another product of rationalism run wild, exercises his charisma with ruthless authority and total amorality. His unhappiness is accounted for when he confesses to a ghastly sexual crime - in a chapter long suppressed by the censor. This prophetic account of modern morals and politics, with its fifty-odd characters, amazing events and challenging ideas, is seen by some critics as Dostoevskys masterpiece.</p><p>Nicholson holds a Bachelor of Science degree.</p><h2>Interactive Student Edition Volume 1 (consumable) 2015 (HMH Integrated Math 1)</h2><p>2015 Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Integrated Mathematics 1 Volume 1 (P) by Timothy D.

I looked back at her, a bit confused as to why my teacher would tell me I was wrong. I probably started to disagree. "I think you mean the rats that ate more protein ran more," she said again. "But that's okay. Thank you for telling us about the experiment." She turned to the class. "Class, thank Tom for the opportunity to learn about this experiment." That was probably the first nutritional disagreement of my life, and honestly, I had no idea what was going on.<br><br>I was in grade school, standing in front of the class giving a presentation. My dad, T. Colin Campbell, PhD, had long been a nutritional biochemist who, among other things, had been conducting cutting-edge research on the influence of diet on cancer at Cornell University. He had a robust research program that was gaining national recognition, and some of his research utilized rats eating different types of diets. He had offered my teacher the opportunity to conduct a little experiment in class involving rats. Nothing pleases elementary students more than having rodents in the classroom, so of course this seemed like a perfect idea.<br><br>The experiment explored the following question: If you fed rats different levels of protein, which rats would exercise the most? Each of the rats I brought in was housed in a cage with an exercise wheel that had a counter rigged up to register the number of times the rats turned the wheel. It was like a rat pedometer. The rats would intermittently get on the wheel and run and run and run--with purpose. It made me wonder if they knew they were not going anywhere, but I suppose you could ask the same thing at your local gym. Animals just need to exercise, I guess, even if it involves not actually going anywhere.<br><br>Both groups of rats ate exactly the same dietary chow with just one variation: One group had a low-protein chow (probably about 5 percent protein) and the other group had a high-protein chow (probably about 20 percent protein). The low-protein chow had a bit more sugar to replace the protein component.<br><br>I would feed the rats faithfully and record exactly how much they exercised. My dad supplied everything, of course. As you might imagine, as an elementary school student I didn't really know what was going on. I had some very cute rats and I wrote down the wheel counter results and I fed them. It was a good life.<br><br>After a week or two, I accumulated all of my data and got my final result: The low-protein rats exercised more. I was a compulsive child, relishing the details and double-checking all my records carefully. At the end of the experiment, I stood up in front of the class and reported the data to the other sniffly kids. The rats eating the low-protein diet ran more on their wheels, I said. This was when my teacher interjected, telling me I got either the rats or the numbers mixed up, that surely I meant that the rats eating the high-protein chow exercised more. As a young student, I had no idea why my teacher would disagree with my findings. She was a wonderful teacher--very caring, enthusiastic, and nurturing. She was one of my favorite teachers.<br><br>But I certainly did not get the numbers mixed up. She hadn't recorded the exercise wheel counts; I had. How would she know what the results were? I probably told her I was actually right, but I can't remember. I was also a stubborn child. It's funny--I can't remember much about the experience of the experiment, but for some reason I have remembered the teacher telling me I got things mixed up. And so went the first nutritional disagreement of my life. I didn't know it at the time, but this was my first lesson in the absolute reverence people have for protein.<br><br>GETTING TO KNOW DAD<br><br>Despite getting to play with rats in elementary school, I was not particularly enamored with my dad's work or with nutrition early in life. As a child and adolescent, I barely knew what he did for work. I was much more interested in sports and friends. Since that time, I have traveled a long, winding path to where I am today. In my nostalgia, it is hard not to think about some of the most remarkable experiences I have had since that time, particularly during my training as a medical doctor. I will never forget the life-and-death moments I have been privy to: doing chest compressions on a man who should have been in the prime of his life; doing chest compressions on a baby born at 26 weeks of gestation not even struggling to take in the first breath. I have been the person to tell someone that their mom was dying, or their spouse was dying, or that their imaging results showed a mass likely to be cancer. I have seen jubilant tears of joy and triumph and quiet love while helping to deliver almost 100 babies. I have assisted in the operating room at a variety of surgeries on patients made sterile by the patchwork of blue drapes around the surgical field. I will never forget some of these experiences. Nor will I forget the work, the stress, or the agony of uncertainty when nothing less than perfection is expected.<br><br>These moments may seem like they have nothing to do with nutrition, but the only reason I ever lived them was because of my experience in nutrition. I did not choose at an early age to become a doctor. Instead, it was a path I chose after working with my father and being inspired to pursue a career in health. After a childhood of not being aware of what type of work my dad did and later making forays into theater and acting, even immigration law, my path dramatically changed in my midtwenties. I had the opportunity to work with my dad as coauthor of The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted and the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss and Long-Term Health, in which we tell the story of his career and the most exciting results in his research. In addition, we detail the findings of many dozens of other researchers investigating diet and health. In all of this, there is a surprisingly consistent, inspiring message: Whole-food, plant-based diets are profoundly important in preventing and even treating disease.<br><br>Much of my dad's work focused on protein and cancer. Having grown up on a dairy farm and gone on to school to find out how we might produce high- quality animal protein more efficiently, he started with the same reverence for protein that my grade school teacher had. But he went on to conduct decades of experimental research on diet and cancer using a variety of experimental rodent models. The research revealed that cancer caused by a dose of a potent cancer-causing chemical can be almost entirely controlled by protein intake. In fact, one of the most provocative experiments found that early cancer growth can be turned on or off simply by changing the level of protein consumed. And guess what? High-protein diets were the most dangerous kind. The figure below shows a 12-week experiment1 in which protein intake was changed every 3 weeks. It shows how diets composed of 5 percent protein turned off early cancer growth, whereas 20 percent protein diets promoted early cancer growth.<br><br>Perhaps the biggest surprise was that the protein that promoted cancer in these experimental models was casein, the main protein in cow's milk. Wheat2 and soy protein in their naturally occurring forms in food do not promote cancer, even at higher levels of intake. Furthermore, protein intake affects cancer initiation and promotion in numerous ways. Dietary composition did not exert its cancer-related effects through one enzyme or one chemical; instead, it changed just about every biochemical aspect of cancer initiation and promotion that was investigated. For decades, funding sources such as the National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer Society, and the American Institute for Cancer Research awarded my dad's research team highly competitive grant money, and the results of their work were published in prestigious peer-reviewed journals.<br><br>We also wrote about one of the most comprehensive studies of diet and disease ever undertaken--the China Project, for which we named our book. A survey of 6,500 adults in 65 counties in rural China, the study, called the "Grand Prix of epidemiology" in the New York Times,3 probed the relationships between 367 variables. The findings were clear: Even in a population that consumed only small amounts of animal foods, those who consumed more animal foods had higher cholesterol levels, which in turn were linked to higher rates of diseases more common in more affluent cultures, such as several types of cancers and diabetes.4<br><br>High And Low Protein Intake Effects On Early Cancer Growth<br><br>Early Cancer Mass<br><br>20% Protein Diet<br><br>5% Protein Diet<br><br>20% Protein Diet<br><br>5% Protein Diet<br><br>3 6 9 12<br><br>Time (weeks)<br><br>Source: Youngman LD and Campbell TC. The sustained development of preneoplastic lesions depends on high protein intake. Nutrition and Cancer 1992;18:131-142.<br><br>In the years I spent writing and conducting library research, I learned that the argument for plant-based diets had become much more powerful than any one person's research. No single study can "prove" anything, and determining what is likely to be true requires one to survey the depth and breadth of the evidence in favor of any argument. If you're unwilling to spend a couple of years looking for the dietary advice that meets those requirements of having a broad and deep evidence base, I will tell you now that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the argument that we should be eating more unrefined plant foods and less meat, dairy, and processed foods. No other dietary recommendation even comes close in terms of comprehensive support.<br><br>Consider heart disease: We have known for more than 50 years that populations consuming more animal foods have more heart disease.5 In fact, in many traditional plant-based cultures around the world, heart disease has historically been a very rare cause of premature death.6, 7 However, 21st-century America is quite different. How many people with heart disease do you know? Or high blood pressure? Or high cholesterol? Of course, in modern America, heart disease and its risk factors are everywhere. But even once heart disease is advanced, we know that making a change to a healthy lifestyle alone can reverse the disease. Both Dean Ornish, MD, and Caldwell Esselstyn Jr., MD, have reversed their patients' heart disease with diet and lifestyle, and proven it with angiograms (x-rays of the heart vessels). Dr. Ornish's Lifestyle Heart Trial was a randomized, controlled trial in which he put one group of heart-disease patients in a diet and lifestyle program, without cholesterol-lowering drugs, while the other group was given standard medical care. The standard medical care group received the usual medical recommendations (medications, testing, procedures, etc.) without the intensive lifestyle program. The lifestyle group was prescribed a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, with almost no meat or dairy foods and no added fat, along with stress-reduction techniques, exercise, and social support. What followed was nothing less than revolutionary: Despite a lifetime of bad habits having clogged up their arteries, those in the lifestyle group began to see disease reversal within a short period of time. The figure above shows how the blockages in the lifestyle group shrank while the blockages in the standard care group got bigger.8<br><br>Changes in artery blockages with dr.

Intensive lifestyle changes for reversal of coronary heart disease. JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association 1998;280:2001-2007.<br><br>Diabetes is much the same story. Guess which populations have had the lowest rates of type 2 diabetes over the past 100 years? Those that eat high-carbohydrate, low-fat, plant-based diets.9 And we now know that, like heart disease, we can reverse diabetes. In a study published 30 years ago, 13 of 17 diabetic participants who had required daily insulin to control their blood sugar were able to come off insulin within just 3 weeks. Of 23 patients requiring oral medication, 21 were able to discontinue their medications within 3 1/2 weeks. When most people stop taking these blood sugar-lowering medications, their blood sugar level spikes upward. But participants in this program, even those who were stopping their medications, actually saw a decrease in their blood sugar. How did they do it? With a high-carbohydrate, high-fiber, low-fat diet, along with exercise10--the same diet plan that I present in this book.<br><br>Just take a moment and imagine that: If you are on medication for diabetes, within just 2 to 3 weeks of following the China Study Solution, you--with your doctor's okay--might be able to get off all your diabetes medication forever! (Remember, involving your doctor prior to making your dietary change is crucial.)<br><br>Then, of course, there is the weight loss. You can eat as much as you want of the meals described in the back of this book and lose weight while you do it. Studies time and time again have found vegetarians and vegans, on average, to be thinner than their meat-eating counterparts.11-13 In one recent large study, the researchers found that even if two people ate the same number of calories every day, a person who ate 250 more grams of meat a day would gain 4.4 �ds more every 5 years than someone getting those calories from foods other than meat.14 Two hundred and fifty grams is perhaps the size of a steak, or a little more than a dozen chicken nuggets. The study showed that red meat, processed meats (ham, hot dogs, sausage, luncheon meats, bacon, and so on), and yes, even poultry were associated with increased weight gain.14<br><br>Diets containing more healthy, unrefined plants have been shown to prevent or treat a wide range of other diseases. They include kidney disease (including kidney stones), Alzheimer's dementia, gallstones, and certain cancers, including those of the breast, lung, colon, ovaries, uterus, and prostate. Listed below are some of the illnesses shown by published research15 to be associated with improved outcomes with more plant-food intake, or worsened outcomes with more animal-food intake. If there was one pill or one surgical procedure that, without any side effects, got results like those possible with a whole-food, plant-based diet, every single person in America would want to have it.</p><h2>Building Construction Related to the Fire Service</h2><p>[This book] &#34;designed to meet the objectives put forth in the model course outlines for Building Construction for Fire Protection as established by the Fire and Emergency Services Higher Education (FESHE) initiative led by the United States Fire Administration.&#34;--P. x.</p><p></p><h2>Society: The Basics</h2><p>Seeing Sociology in Everyday Life Society: The Basics is designed to help students view their everyday lives through a sociological lens.

Along the way he organizes a band of guerrillas to disrupt the French army&#39;s pursuit. Although the book Rifleman Dodd is fictional, Dodd&#39;s simple, unyielding devotion to his duties as a soldier exemplifies core values - honor, courage and commitment - which all Marines are expected to demonstrate. Rifleman Dodd is based on a real event in history - the Peninsular Wars. Rifleman Dodd is commitment personified. He never thinks in terms of surrender. He doesn&#39;t just escape and evade - he continues to perform as a rifleman, killing enemy soldiers. In one of the opening chapters, Dodd is discovered by a French soldier as he is making his way back to his company. He flees in the opposite direction and finds himself scaling a steep hill. The French don&#39;t wish to follow him any farther. Instead of escaping from the impending danger, Dodd takes aim on a cluster of soldiers at the foot of the hill. As revenge for the French halting his return to his unit, he fires and kills one of the Frenchmen. When he finally returns to his unit, no one knows of the deeds he has done, and his simple reward is a hot meal and the company of his mates.</p><p>Cecil Scott &#34;C.S.&#34; Forester was the pen name of Cecil Louis Troughton Smith (27 August 1899 - 2 April 1966), an English novelist who rose to fame with tales of naval warfare.

The village has its share of types, from the vicar, to the ungrammatical school children, to grumpy Mrs. Pringle. Each character is fittingly presented, and many become recognizable. Miss Read excels at description and dialogue, which the narrator aptly handles. The title suggests pathos, which Phillips handles with sparkle, rather than tears. Anyone who enjoys reading about people and their foibles will fall in love with Miss Read. S.G.B.

The similarities among the molecular or diffusive transport mechanisms--heat conduction, diffusion of chemical species, and viscous transfer of momentum--are highlighted. Conservation equations for scalar quantites are derived first in general form, and then used to obtain the governing equations for total mass, energy, and chemical species. The scaling and order-of-magnitude concepts which are crucial in modeling are also introduced. Certain key methods for solving the differential equations in transport problems, including similarity, perturbation, and finite Fourier transform techniques, are described using conduction and diffusion problems as examples. <br> Following chapters are devoted to fluid mechanics, beginning with fundamental equations for momentum transfer and then discussing unidirectional flow, nearly unidirectional (lubrication) flow, creeping flow, and laminar boundary layer flow. Forced-convection heat and mass transfer in laminar flow, multicomponent energy and mass transfer, free convection, and turbulence are also covered. The appendix summarizes vector and tensor operations and relations involving various coordinate systems. <br> Based on twenty years of teaching and extensive class testing, <em>Analysis of Transport Phenomena</em> offers students both extensive coverage of the topic and inclusion of modern examples from bioengineering, membrane science, and materials processing. It is mathematically self-contained and is also unique in its treatment of scaling and approximation techniques and its presentation of the finite Fourier transform method for solving partial differential equations.</p><p>William M.

Written by an unknown poet in about the eighth century, this masterpiece of Anglo-Saxton literature transforms legends, myth, history, and ancient songs into the richly colored tale of the hero Beowulf, the loathsome man-eater Grendel, his vengeful water-hag mother, and a treasure-hoarding dragon. The earliest surviving epic poem in any modern European language. <b>Beowulf</b> is a stirring portrait of a heroic world&#x2013;somber, vast, and magnificent.</p><p>The identity of<b> Beowulf</b>&#x2019;s author and the exact date and place of its composition are unknown. A single copy of the poem, dated about the year 1000, survived Henry VIII&#x2019;s destruction of England&#x2019;s monasteries and was collected by Sir Robert Cotton. This copy was damaged, but not disastrously, in a library fire in 1731 and was finally placed in the British Museum in 1753. The Danish scholar Thorkelin had copies made of it in 1787 and published the whole of it for the first time in 1815. Originally untitled, it is named after its hero, Beowulf, and is divided into two parts: In the first part the young Beowulf battles the monster Gredel and Grendels vengeful mother; in the second, an aged Beowulf kills a fire-breathing dragon but is himself mortally wounded.<br><br>No historic Beowulf is known to have existed, but some events described in the poem did take place in the sixth century. Early scholars tried to prove that more than one poet wrote the work, but it is now generally accepted that, like the Iliad&#x2019;s Homer, there was one composer of <b>Beowulf</b>, who took the stories, legends, and myths of his culture&#x2019;s oral traditions and bound them together with his own artistic vision. Written in England at least fifty years after the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity, and perhaps much later, the poem is recognized today as the longest and greatest poem extant in Old English&#x2013;yet it describes an ancient heroic society of Danes and Geats in Scandinavia; there is not one word about England, or about the people who come to be known as the English, in the poem.PROLOGUE: <br>The Founding of the Scylding Dynasty<br>Indeed, we have heard of the glory of the great Danish kings in days of old and the noble deeds of the princes. Scyld Scefing often drove troops of enemies from their mead-hall seats; he terrified the lords of many tribes, although he had once been a destitute foundling. He found consolation for that: he prospered under the heavens, and grew in glory, until every one of his neighbors over the sea had to obey him and pay tribute. That was a good king.<br><br>Then a son was born to him, a child in the house, sent by God to help the people&#x2014;he saw the distress they had suffered before when they were without a ruler for a long time. Therefore the Lord of life, Ruler of heaven, granted worldly honor to the son of Scyld. Beowulf was famous; his renown spread far and wide in the land of the Danes. A young man should do as he did, and with splendid gifts from his father's store win loyal companions who will stand by him in old age and serve the people when war comes. He who does praiseworthy deeds will prosper everywhere.<br><br>Scyld departed from him at the fated time: the mighty man went into the keeping of the Lord. His own dear retainers bore away the beloved king, who had governed them so long, to the current of the sea, as he himself had ordered while he could still use words. There in the harbor stood a ring-prowed ship, covered with ice and ready to set out; it was a craft fit for a prince. They laid their dear lord, the giver of rings, in the bosom of the ship; they put the glorious one by the mast. Many treasures and precious things from far away were brought there&#x2014;never was a ship more beautifully equipped with armor and weapons of war, swords and coats of mail. On the dead lord's bosom lay a multitude of treasures that were to go far with him in the power of the flood; nor did they give him less valuable treasure than did those who first sent him forth, alone over the waves, when he was a child. They set a golden banner high over his head; then they gave him to the sea and let the water carry him away. Their spirits were saddened, their hearts mournful. Men on earth, even the wisest of counselors, do not know how to tell who truly received that cargo.<br>PART I: The Cleansing of Heorot<br><br><i>Heorot Is Built and Assaulted by the Monster Grendel</i><br><br>1<br><br>When the prince his father was gone, Beowulf, son of Scyld, reigned over the people; he was renowned among nations for a long time. To him in turn was born high Healfdene, who rules the Danes gloriously as long as he lived&#x2014;a venerable leader, fierce in battle. To Healfdene, the leader of hosts, four children all told were born into the world: Heorogar and Hrothgar and Halga the Good, and a daughter, who, they say, was Onela's queen&#x2014;consort of the Swedish king.<br><br>Then Hrothgar was granted success in battle and glory in war, so that his friends and kinsmen obeyed him willingly, and his band of warriors grew large. It came into his mind to order a great mead-hall built, one which the children of men should hear of forever; there he would give out all that God gave him (except the public land and the lives of men) to young and old. I have heard that he then ordered work to adorn the building from nations far and wide throughout this earth. The time soon came when the greatest of halls was quite ready, and the ruler whose word was widely respected gave it the name of Heorot. He did not forget his promise to give out rings and treasures at the feast. The hall towered, high and wide-gabled: it awaited the hostile flames of hateful fire. The time had not yet come when deadly hate would arise between a son and father-in-law after a deed of violence.<br><br>This was a time of suffering for the powerful demon who dwelt in darkness, when he heard loud rejoicing in the hall every day. There was the sound of the harp and the sweet song of the minstrel, who told about the creation of men, long ago; he said that the Almighty made the earth, the beautiful land bounded by the water; then, triumphant, he placed the sun and the moon as a light to lighten those who dwell on the land, and adorned the earth with branches and leaves; and he also created every living creature which moves after its kind.&#x2014;Thus the retainers of Hrothgar lived in joy and happiness, until the hellish fiend began his wicked deeds.<br><br>This grim spirit was called Grendel. A notorious prowler of the waste lands, he held sway in the moors, the fen and fastness. The miserable creature had long inhabited the haunts of monsters, since the Creator had condemned him and all his race, the progeny of Cain,in vengeance for the slaying of Abel. Cain got no joy by his murderous act, but was banished by the eternal Lord; God drove him from mankind for that crime. Of his race were born all evil broods&#x2014;ogres, elves, and monsters, and the giants who contended against God for a long time&#x2014;he paid them back for that!<br>2<br><br>When night fell, Grendel went to seek out the lofty house, to see how the Danes had settled down after drinking beer. There, inside, he found the band of noble warriors, sleeping after the feast: they did not know sorrow and the misery of men. Grim and greedy, the evil creature was alert at once: the cruel and savage monster took from their beds thirty of the thanes. Then he left there, exulting in his booty, seeking out his home with his fill of slaughter.<br><br>Then a dawn, with the break of day, Grendel's might in warfare was no secret to men. Where there had been feast and merrymaking, weeping arose, a great cry in the morning.<br><br>The glorious chief sat joyless; the prince, mighty of old, endured sorrow for his thanes when they saw the track of the foe, the accursed demon. The trouble now was severe beyond measure, hateful and long lasting: there was no further respite, but again the next night he committed more murder&#x2014;he did not shrink from hostile act and wicked deed, for he was too fixed in the fetters of sin. Now it was easy to find a man who looked for a resting place further away, a bed in other buildings, when he had seen clear signs of the hall-visitor's hatred: he who escaped the enemy kept himself further away in a safer place.<br><br>The monster prevailed in this way and contended against right, one against all, until the best of houses stood empty. That lasted a long time: for twelve winters the Danish lord was afflicted with these troubles and suffered great sorrow. Sad lays made it openly known to men that Grendel warred against Hrothgar for a long time; he waged warfare, committed wicked deeds and hostile acts, for many seasons of continual strife. He did not want peace with any of the Danish host; he did not wish to stop his deadly evil, nor to settle the feud with payment&#x2014;none of the counselors had reason to expect great compensation from the hand of the murderer. On the contrary, the dark death-shadow persecuted young and old, lingered and ambushed. He held the misty moors in perpetual darkness&#x2014;no man knows where such demons go.<br><br>Thus the enemy of mankind, the fearful outcast, often did many wicked deeds and perpetrated greivous injuries. In the dark nights he prowled Heorot, the richly decorated hall; but he could not approach the throne, the seat where treasure was given&#x2014;God prevented him&#x2014;nor feel gratitude for gifts.<br><br>That was heartbreaking misery for the Scylding's lord. Many great leaders frequently sat in counsel pondering plans, in deliberation as to what would be best for brave-spirited men to do against the awful horror. At times they made sacrifices to idols in heathen temples, entreating the devil to help them relieve the distress of the people. Such was their custom, the hope of heathens&#x2014;their thoughts were on hell, for they did not know their Creator, the Judge of deeds: they neither knew the Lord God nor understood how to worship the Protector of the heavens, the Ruler of glories. Woe to him who, in cruel affliction, shall thrust his soul into the embrace of the fire&#x2014;he shall know no comfort or change. Well shall it be for him who may go to the Lord after the day of death and ask for peace in the bosom of the Father!<br>Beowulf's Arrival<br><br>3<br><br>So Healfdene's son brooded continually over the trouble of the time; nor could the wise prince turn that misery aside. The strife which had come upon the people was too hateful and enduring, a cruel, dire distress&#x2014;the greatest of evils that come by night.<br><br>A brave man of the tribe of the Geats, a thane of Hygelac,heard in his homeland of Grendel's deeds. He was the strongest and mightiest man alive, noble and stalwart. He ordered a good ship prepared for him, saying he wished to seek out the warrior king over the road of the swans, since that glorious leader had need of men. Wise men did not blame him for this venture, although he was dear to them: they encouraged the brave man, and looked at the omens. The hero had chosen the keenest champions he could find among the Geatish people, and it was as one of fifteen that he led the way to the ship, a skilled seaman guiding his band along the shore.<br><br>In good time the boat was on the waves, floating under the cliffs. Watchful men climbed the prow. The ocean streams eddied, sea washed against sand, as the men bore bright trappings and splendid armor into the ship. The men shoved out: the warriors launched the well-braced craft on the longed-for journey. Driven by the wind, the boat went over the billowy sea, foamy necked, like a bird, until in due time on the following day the curved prow had advanced so that the seafarers saw land; they sighted the shining sea cliffs, the steep banks of the shore, the broad headlands. The sea had been crossed and the voyage was at an end. Quickly the people of the Geats mounted on the land and moored the ship&#x2014;their battle garments, shirts of mail, rattled&#x2014;and thanked God that their voyage had been easy.<br><br>From the wall the Danish guard, who had the duty of keeping watch on the sea cliffs, saw bright shields and ready armor brought over the gangway: he was very curious to know what men these were. Hrothgar's thane rode his horse to the shore, brandishing a mighty spear in his hand, and spoke in formal words: "What manner of men are you, warriors in armor, who have thus come in your lofty ship here across the sea? I have been coast guard here for a long time, holding watch by the sea so that no enemy force might harry the land of the Danes. Never have armed men come here more openly&#x2014;yet you did not have leave from our warriors, or the agreement of kinsmen. Never have I seen a mightier nobleman in the world, a greater man in armor, than one among you: surely that is no mere hall retainer exalted with weapons&#x2014;may his splendid countenance, his peerless appearance, never belie him!&#x2014;Now I must know your lineage before you may go further, possibly spying on the land of the Danes; strangers, seafarers, now hear my plain thought: best make it known quickly where you come from."<br>4<br><br>The chief answered him; the leader of the band said, "We are people of the Geatish nation, Hygelac's hearth companions. My father was a noble leader well known among nations; he was called Ecgtheow. He lived through many winters, and was an old man when he departed from this world. Wise men remember him well all over the earth. We come with friendly intentions to seek your lord, the son of Healfdene; be of good counsel to us! We have a weighty errand to the glorious lord of the Danes&#x2014;nor, I think, will there be anything secret about it. You know whether what we have heard is true: that an enemy&#x2014;I know not who, a mysterious persecutor&#x2014;shows his strange hostility among the Danes in the dark nights and works injury and slaughter in a terrible way. I may be able to give Hrothgar sincere good counsel as to how he, who is so good and wise, may overcome the fiend&#x2014;if a change is ever to be, if a cure for these miserable afflictions is to come in its turn, and sorrows end. Otherwise, he will suffer trials and distress for ever after, as long as the best of houses remains in its lofty place."<br><br>The guard, a fearless officer, spoke as he sat there on his horse: "An acute warrior who has a clear mind should be a judge of both words and deeds. I understand that this band is friendly to the lord of the Danes. Go on with your weapons and armor; I will guide you. Also, I shall bid my men to guard your boat honorably against every enemy, watch over the newly tarred vessel on the sand, until the curved-prowed ship again bears its beloved lord over the sea to the land of the Geats. One who does brave deeds will be allowed to survive the storm of battle unhurt."<br><br>They went on their way. The ship remained; the spacious vessel was moored with a rope, fast at anchor. Over the warriors' cheek-guards shone boar figures, decorated with gold, shining and hardened by fire: the warlike boar kept guard over the fierce ones. The company hastened until they could perceive the timbered hall, splendid and decorated with gold; that was the most famous building under heaven, the dwelling of the mighty lord; its light shone over many lands. The guard showed them that bright home of brave men so that they could go straight to it, then turned his horse and said, "It is time for me to go. May the almighty Father, by his grace, keep you safe in your undertaking! I shall go to the sea to keep watch against hostile bands."<br>5<br><br>The street was paved with stone, and the path guided the band of men. Chain-mail gleamed and bright iron rings sang in their armor as they came to the hall in their warlike gear. Weary of the sea, they set their broad, strong shields against the wall of the building and sat down on the bench, with a ringing of chain mail. Their spears, war gear of seamen, stood gathered together, the ashwood gleaming gray at the tip; the band was well equipped with weapons.<br><br>There a noble champion asked the warriors of their descent: "From where have you brought decorated shields, gray coats of mail and visored helmets, a host of spears? I am Hrothgar's herald and officer. Never have I seen a bolder band of strangers. I think you have come to Hrothgar in daring mood: not as exiles seeking refuge, but as brave men in search of glory."<br><br>The famous hero answered him: strong in his helmet, the valiant Geat replied, "We are Hygelac's table-companions: Beowulf is my name. I wish to tell my errand to the son of Healfdene, the glorious prince who is your lord, if he who is so great will allow us to greet him."<br><br>Wulfgar replied (he was a prince of the Wendels, well known for his wisdom and valor): "I will ask the lord and ruler of the Danes, the giver of rings, as you request. I shall tell the glorious lord of your venture and quickly bring you back the answer the great one thinks fit to give me."<br><br>Quickly he turned to the place where Hrothgar, old and gray, sat with his band of nobles; the valiant warrior went up and stood by the shoulder of the Danish lord&#x2014;he knew the custom of the court. Wulfgar spoke to his lord: "Geatish people are here, come from over the expanse of the water; the warriors call their chief Beowulf. My lord, they ask to exchange words with you. Do not refuse them your answer, gracious Hrothgar! They are well-armed men who seem worthy of the respect of nobles; and the chief who led these warriors here is certainly a powerful man."<br>6<br><br>Hrothgar, the Scyldings' protector, spoke: "I knew him when he was a boy. His father was called Ecgtheow: to him Hrethel, king of the Geats, gave his only daughter in marriage. Now his brave son has come here to see a loyal friend. Seafarers who have carried gifts for the pleasure of the Geats said that this famous warrior has the strength of thirty men in his grip. I expect that holy God in his grace has sent him to the Danes to help us against Grendel's terror.

Highly sought-after management consultant Patrick Lencioni deftly told the tale of a young CEO who, facing his first annual board review, knows he is failing, but doesn't know why. Refreshingly original and utterly compelling, this razor-sharp novelette plus self-assessment (written to be read in one sitting) serves as a timeless and potent reminder that success as a leader can come down to practicing a few simple behaviors?behaviors that are painfully difficult for each of us to master. Any executive can learn how to recognize the mistakes that leaders can make and how to avoid them. The lessons of <i>The Five Temptations of a CEO,</i> are as relevant today as ever, and this special anniversary edition celebrates ten years of inspiration and enlightenment with a brand new introduction and reflections from Lencioni on the new challenges in business and leadership that have occurred in the past ten years.</p><p>Imagine running into the ultimate management mentor late one night on an otherwise deserted commuter train, and walking away from the strange encounter with an encapsulated guide to success in the corporate world. That's exactly what screenwriter and business coach Patrick Lencioni has done in <i>The Five Temptations of a CEO: A Leadership Fable</i>, placing his tale in an easy-reading and thought- provoking kind of self-help novel. <p> Designed to be read in a single sitting, this book uses the unexpected meeting between troubled high-tech honcho Andrew O'Brien and a mysterious old man named Charlie to explore a series of common traps that can unwittingly ensnare any hard-driven executive. Lencioni hones in on the five "temptations" of the workplace: desires to jealously guard career status, consistently remain popular with subordinates, unfailingly make correct decisions, constantly strive for an atmosphere of total harmony, and always appear invulnerable. A discussion of the story's events and their real-world implications follows, as Lencioni shifts from screenwriter mode to business coach to help answer some of the questions he raises. <i>--Howard Rothman</i></p><p><b>THE COMMEMORATIVE EDITION OF A LANDMARK BOOK FROM PATRICK LENCIONI</b> </p><p>"Patrick Lencioni's combination of homey management truths and simple prose has struck a chord with business leaders tired of jargon and complicated strategic models."<br> <b>&#x2014;The <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b> </p><p>"This book reflects so much of what I love about Patrick's insights; thought provoking, challenging of the accepted, simple but not simplistic, and highly practical.

In this one-of-a-kind guide, award-winning author, essayist, teacher, and editor Lee Gutkind gives you concise, pointed advice on every aspect of writing and selling your work, including:<br>* Guidelines for choosing provocative--and salable--topics<br>* Smart research techniques--including advice on conducting penetrating interviews and using electronic research tools<br>* Tips for focusing and structuring a piece for maximum effectiveness<br>* Advice on working successfully with editors and literary agents</p><p>This book is for the beginning creative nonfiction writer--one who needs to be told that writers are an eccentric lot; one who has never heard of the Yaddo artists' colony. Still, Lee Gutkind, the author of several books of creative nonfiction and the founder/editor of the journal <i>Creative Nonfiction</i>, has some interesting things to tell us about this genre of writing, which strives to communicate real-life stories dramatically. The most important quality that a creative nonfiction writer can have, writes Gutkind, is passion: "A passion for the written word; a passion for the search and discovery of knowledge; and a passion for ... understand[ing] intimately how things in this world work." Gutkind offers instruction on finding story ideas, focusing one's work, keeping story files, fact checking, and interviewing; he tells us what to expect from editors and agents; and he teaches us how to know when we're ready to start writing (when you can "think of nothing more to ask or to learn"). Perhaps the best tidbit here is Gutkind's emphasis on delving deeply into one's subject matter without inserting oneself into the situation. "While immersing myself in a writing project," he says, "I routinely like to compare myself to a rather undistinguished and utilitarian end table in a living room or office. It is a fixture. You walk in and out of your living room dozens of times a day. You see the table, you <i>expect</i> to see the table, but you do not say, 'Well, there is the table, hello table.'" Appendices include a sample book proposal and readings.A pioneer in the writing and teaching of nonfiction presents a practical guide to composing creative nonfiction that covers the entire process--from initial psychological preparation to marketing a finished piece. Written in an engaging style, the book provides pertinent information on conducting research, using interviews, &#34;immersion journalism,&#34; cinematic writing, the ethical and moral concerns of writing subjective truth and more. Features examples culled from the author&#39;s journal, Creative Nonfiction, to illustrate writing techniques.</p><h2>Student Activities Manual for Golosa: A Basic Course in Russian, Book Two</h2><p>The Fifth edition of the best-selling communicatively based text for beginning Russian is enhanced by a greater focus on contemporary culture and simplified, visual grammar explanations that will better engage your students.

The story turns on the marriage prospects of the five daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet: Elizabeth forms a prejudice against the proud and distant Mr. Darcy; Darcy&#x2019;s charming friend Charles Bingley falls in love with her sister Jane; and the handsome officer George Wickham forms attachments successively to Elizabeth and to her sister Lydia. </p> <p> Irvine&#x2019;s extensive introduction sets the novel in the context of the literary and intellectual history of the period, and deals with such crucial background issues as early-nineteenth century class relations in Britain, and female exclusion from property and power. The appendices present an unrivaled selection of background contextual documents. </p></p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Michel Foucault in particular made us aware that whatever our functionally defined "roles" in society, we are constantly negotiating questions of authority and the control of the definitions of reality. Such insights have led theorists to challenge concepts that have long formed the very underpinnings of their disciplines. By exploring some of the most debated of these concepts--"culture," "power," and "history"--this reader offers an enriching perspective on social theory in the contemporary moment.</p><br><p> Organized around these three concepts, <i>Culture/ Power/History</i> brings together both classic and new essays that address Foucault's "new economy of power relations" in a number of different, contestatory directions. Representing innovative work from various disciplines and sites of study, from taxidermy to Madonna, the book seeks to affirm the creative possibilities available in a time marked by growing uncertainty about established disciplinary forms of knowledge and by the increasing fluidity of the boundaries between them. The book is introduced by a major synthetic essay by the editors, which calls attention to the most significant issues enlivening theoretical discourse today. The editors seek not only to encourage scholars to reflect anew on the course of social theory, but also to orient newcomers to this area of inquiry.</p><br><p> The essays are contributed by Linda Alcoff ("Cultural Feminism versus Post-Structuralism"), Sally Alexander ("Women, Class, and Sexual Differences in the 1830s and 1840s"), Tony Bennett ("The Exhibitionary Complex"), Pierre Bourdieu ("Structures, Habitus, Power"), Nicholas B.

Rather, a proper approach to prophecy acknowledges that the threads of prophecy crisscross throughout Genesis to Revelation, forming the fabric of canonical Scripture. This is why having a good grasp of the prophetic genre is essential for understanding the message of the entire Bible. Authors Alan Bandy and Benjamin Merkle not only offer thoughtful and careful explanations of individual biblical prophecies, but also give the reader the big picture of how all prophecy relates to and should be interpreted in light of Jesus Christ.</p> <p>This book examines the nature, themes, purposes, and theology of biblical prophecy and provides a framework for how to interpret any passage in the context of the Bible as a whole.</p></p><p><b> Alan S.

Rejecting the common interpretation of Don Quixote as a warm satire, Nabokov perceives the work as a catalog of cruelty through which the gaunt knight passes. Edited and with a Preface by Fredson Bowers; photographs.<br></p><p>Vladimir Nabokov (1899-1977), Russian-born poet, novelist, literary critic, translator, and essayist was awarded the National Medal for Literature for his life&#39;s work in 1973. He taught literature at Wellesley, Stanford, Cornell, and Harvard. He is the author of many works including Lolita, Pale Fire, Ada, and Speak, Memory.Quite the least interesting, most dutiful of Nabokov's collegiate lectures on literature, these talks on Don Quixote were given at Harvard, 1951-52. Again, Nabokov applies principles of categorization to the text at hand: dimensions, numbering, topographies, maps. And he offers some (but not much) general discussion of the book's enduring genius. "What we shall witness now is the evolution of the epic form, the shedding of its metrical skin, the hoofing of its feet, a sudden fertile cross between the winged monster of the epic and the specialized prose form of entertaining narration, more or less a domesticated mammal, if I may pursue the metaphor to its lame end;" Nabokov sees Don Quixote as a logical continuation of earlier chivalric romances, "with the elements of madness and shame and mystification increased." The book, he finds, is one of those "perhaps more important in eccentric diffusion than in their intrinsic value." Clearly not one of Nabokov's favorite books, he sees it as neither humane nor humorous: a whole section of the lectures is given over to literally scoring (as in tennis) the Don's cruel humiliations. And Cervantes' comedy receives little praise: "Dulcinea shall be restored to Don Quixote if - now comes the rib-splitting joke - if Sancho consents to take 3000 lashes on his bare behind. Otherwise, says the Duke when he hears of the requirement, you do not get your island. The whole thing is very medieval, coarse, and stupid fun, as all fun that comes from the devil. Authentic humor comes from the angels." True, Nabokov is sometimes entertaining when he kibbitzes, one novelist to another, taking Cervantes to task for not having done a scene better; he does admire the hapless Don himself. ("He stands for everything that is gentle, forlorn, pure, unselfish, and gallant. The parody has become a paragon.") But the bon mots here are scarce, and the book is little more than an acerbic, uninvolved study-guide - for Nabokov fanatics only.

In this long-awaited sequel, Buchanan brings this story to its dramatic conclusion.</p><p>Greene&#x2019;s Southern Campaign was the most difficult of the war. With a supply line stretching hundreds of miles northward, it revealed much about the crucial military art of provision and transport. Insufficient manpower a constant problem, Greene attempted to incorporate black regiments into his army, a plan angrily rejected by the South Carolina legislature. A bloody civil war between Rebels and Tories was wreaking havoc on the South at the time, forcing Greene to address vigilante terror and restore civilian government. As his correspondence with Thomas Jefferson during the campaign shows, Greene was also bedeviled by the conflict between war and the rights of the people, and the question of how to set constraints under which a free society wages war.</p><p>Joining Greene is an unforgettable cast of characters&#x2015;men of strong and, at times, antagonistic personalities&#x2015;all of whom are vividly portrayed. We also follow the fate of Greene&#x2019;s tenacious foe, Lieutenant Colonel Francis, Lord Rawdon. By the time the British evacuate Charleston&#x2015;and Greene and his ragged, malaria-stricken, faithful Continental Army enter the city in triumph&#x2015;the reader has witnessed in telling detail one of the most punishing campaigns of the Revolution, culminating in one of its greatest victories.</p><p></p></p><p><p>John Buchanan, former chief registrar of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is the author of <i>The Road to Valley Forge: How Washington Built the Army that Won the Revolution</i> and <i>The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas.</i></p><p>Using primary sources along with historian analysis, Buchanan presents a lively chronicle of the arduous fight of the Americans to reclaim Georgia and the Carolinas.... With a colorful cast of characters...[t]his engaging read for military and American history enthusiasts provides an in-depth review and argument for the criticality of Greene&#x2019;s contribution to American Independence.</p> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Outstanding&#x2015;easily the best in the literature on the subject. Buchanan argues persuasively that human agency is as vital a factor in war as chance, and that Greene&#x2019;s decisions, both good and bad, were critical in the eventual American success in the southern theater. His book is military history at its best."</p> (Mark Edward Lender, Kean University, coauthor of <i>Fatal Sunday: George Washington, the Monmouth Campaign, and the Politics of Battle</i>)<br><br><p>Written in the same lively, engaging style as his prior "Road to" books on the American Revolution, Jack Buchanan's <i>The Road to Charleston</i> will likewise become essential reading for anyone interested in the Revolution's Southern Campaign. The author does not shy from taking an opinionated stand (always well supported) on controversial or long disputed issues, such as the Waxhaws massacre, the Siege of Ninety Six, and--in a particularly masterful chapter--the Battle of Eutaw Springs, the most important of Nathanael Greene's South Carolina engagements. What emerges is a vivid portrait of Greene--"a great and good man" who, through genius and persistence, drove the British from Charleston.</p> (John Oller, author of <i>The Swamp Fox: How Francis Marion Saved the American Revolution</i> and <i>American Queen: The Rise and Fall of Kate Chase Sprague--Civil War "Belle of the North" and Gilded Age Woman of Scandal</i>)<br><br><p> <i>The Road to Charleston</i> stands as an imposing sequel to Buchanan's classic earlier works on the American Revolutionary War.

The part of the story many Americans don&#x2019;t know is that the Revolutionary War dragged on for another year and three months, more or less, with a lot more fighting in the South, where the British continued to do battle in the hope that Americans who remained loyal to the crown would join them in putting down the rebellion.....

Although his tenure in office was relatively short, Sankara left an indelible mark on his country&#x2019;s history and development. An avowed Marxist, he outspokenly asserted his country&#x2019;s independence from France and other Western powers while at the same time seeking to build a genuine pan-African unity.<br><br>Ernest Harsch traces Sankara&#x2019;s life from his student days to his recruitment into the military, early political awakening, and increasing dismay with his country&#x2019;s extreme poverty and political corruption. As he rose to higher leadership positions, he used those offices to mobilize people for change and to counter the influence of the old, corrupt elites. Sankara and his colleagues initiated economic and social policies that shifted away from dependence on foreign aid and toward a greater use of the country&#x2019;s own resources to build schools, health clinics, and public works. Although Sankara&#x2019;s sweeping vision and practical reforms won him admirers both in Burkina Faso and across Africa, a combination of domestic opposition groups and factions within his own government and the army finally led to his assassination in 1987.<br><br>This is the first English-language book to tell the story of Sankara&#x2019;s life and struggles, drawing on the author&#x2019;s extensive firsthand research and reporting on Burkina Faso, including interviews with the late leader. Decades after his death, Sankara remains an inspiration to young people throughout Africa for his integrity, idealism, and dedication to independence and self-determination.</p></p><p><strong>Ernest Harsch</strong> is a research scholar at the Institute of African Studies at Columbia University. He worked on African issues at the United Nations for more than twenty years and is the author of <i>South Africa: White Rule, Black Revolt.</i>&#x201c;<i>Thomas Sankara: An African Revolutionary</i> will serve as an excellent introduction to Sankara and the revolution in Burkina Faso and explain why Sankara continues to be so widely admired throughout Africa and beyond.&#x201d;&#x2014;Christopher Wise, author of <i>Derrida, Africa, and the Middle East </i><br><br>&#x201c;...[A] fascinating read about a leader who not only led a revolution to free his people ... but also lived a simple and humble life, uncorrupted by the power of the office he held.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Africa Renewal</i><br><br>&#x201c;Harsch&#x2019;s book helps us understand why [Sankara's] ideas are still very much alive.

Hundreds of lives were lost on both sides, and the war ended with the execution of thirty-eight Dakotas on December 26, 1862, in Mankato, Minnesota&#x2014;the largest mass execution in American history. The following April, after suffering a long internment at Fort Snelling, the Dakota and Winnebago peoples were forcefully removed to South Dakota, precipitating the near destruction of the area&#x2019;s native communities while simultaneously laying the foundation for what we know and recognize today as Minnesota.&nbsp;<i>In North Country: The Making of Minnesota</i>, Mary Lethert Wingerd unlocks the complex origins of the state&#x2014;origins that have often been ignored in favor of legend and a far more benign narrative of immigration, settlement, and cultural exchange. Moving from the earliest years of contact between Europeans and the indigenous peoples of the western Great Lakes region to the era of French and British influence during the fur trade and beyond, Wingerd charts how for two centuries prior to official statehood Native people and Europeans in the region maintained a hesitant, largely cobeneficial relationship. Founded on intermarriage, kinship, and trade between the two parties, this racially hybridized society was a meeting point for cultural and economic exchange until the western expansion of American capitalism and violation of treaties by the U.S. government during the 1850s wore sharply at this tremulous bond, ultimately leading to what Wingerd calls Minnesota&#x2019;s Civil War.&nbsp;A cornerstone text in the chronicle of Minnesota&#x2019;s history, Wingerd&#x2019;s narrative is augmented by more than 170 illustrations chosen and described by Kirsten Delegard in comprehensive captions that depict the fascinating, often haunting representations of the region and its inhabitants over two and a half centuries. <i>North Country</i> is the unflinching account of how the land the Dakota named Mini Sota Makoce became the State of Minnesota and of the people who have called it, at one time or another, home.</p><p><p>Mary Lethert Wingerd is associate professor of history at St. Cloud State University in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

Liuzza&#x2019;s translation of <em>Beowulf</em>, first published by Broadview in 1999, has been widely praised for its accuracy and beauty. The facing-page translation is accompanied in this edition by genealogical charts, historical summaries, and a glossary of proper names. Historical appendices include related legends, stories, and religious writings from both Christian and Anglo-Saxon traditions. These texts help readers to see <em>Beowulf</em> as an exploration of the politics of kingship and the psychology of heroism, and as an early English meditation on the bridges and chasms between the pagan past and the Christian present. </p> <p> Appendices also include a generous sample of other modern translations of <em>Beowulf</em>, shedding light on the process of translating the poem. This new edition features an updated introduction and an expanded section of material on Christianity and paganism. </p></p><p><p> <strong>R.M. Liuzza</strong> is Professor of English at the University of Toronto. </p><p> &#x201c;This <em>Beowulf</em> translation is a masterful synthesis of history, poetry, and narrative.

This is a brilliant, exemplary edition and a must-have for any serious student of the poem. Liuzza has set the standard for many years to come.&#x201d; &#x2015; Stacy S.

As Dr. Nathanson shows, chemicals and illnesses can affect our mood just as surely as an uncomfortable memory or a stern rebuke. Linking for the first time the affect theory of the pioneering researcher Silvan S. Thomkins with the entire world of biology, medicine, psychology, psychotherapy, religion, and the social sciences, Dr. Nathanson presents a completely new understanding of all emotion.<br></p><p>Donald L.

From the supposed memoirs of Hitler's barber: "Then, in January of 1945, a plot by several generals to shave Hitler's moustache in his sleep failed when von Stauffenberg, in the darkness of Hitler's bedroom, shaved off one of the F�hrer's eyebrows instead..." <p> Even though the idea of writing jokes about old Adolf--or addled rabbis, or Maatjes herring--isn't nearly as fresh as it used to be, <i>Getting Even</i> still delivers plenty of laughs. At his best, Woody can achieve a level of transcendent craziness that no other writer can match. If you're looking for a book to dip into at random, or a gift for someone who's seen <i>Sleeper</i> 13 times, <i>Getting Even</i> is a dead lock.</p>Woody Allen revenges himself upon such significant subjects as death, obesity, organized crime, the invention of the sandwich, adult education, laundry lists of famous people, and Latin American revolutionaries.</p><h2>Wedding Bells in Christmas</h2><p><b>To have and to hold from this day forward</b> <br>Wedding bells are ringing in the charming town of Christmas, but not for Vivian Westfield.

Now Stoppard&#x2019;s crowning achievement&#x201d; (David Cote, <i>Time Out New York</i>) has been collected in one volume, with an introduction by the author, and includes the definitive text used during Lincoln Center&#x2019;s recent celebrated run. <i>The Coast of Utopia</i> comprises three sequential plays that chronicle the story of a group of friends who come of age under the Tsarist autocracy of Nicholas I, and for whom the term intelligentsia&#x201d; was coined. Among them are the anarchist Michael Bakunin, who was to challenge Marx for the soul of the masses; Ivan Turgenev, author of some of the most enduring works in Russian literature; the brilliant, erratic young critic Vissarion Belinsky; and Alexander Herzen, a nobleman's son and the first self-proclaimed socialist in Russia, who becomes the main focus of this drama of politics, love, loss, and betrayal. In <i>The Coast of Utopia</i>, Stoppard presents an inspired examination of the struggle between romantic anarchy, utopian idealism, and practical reformation in what <i>The New York Times</i> calls brilliant, sprawling . . . a rich pageant.&#x201d;</p><p>Tom Stoppard is the author of such seminal works as <i>Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead, Travesties, Every Good Boy Deserves a Favor, Arcadia, Jumpers, The Real Thing,</i> and <i>The Invention of Love</i> ."Contains some of Stoppard's best writing. Nobody in the theater today can match him for a combintaion of sinuous argument, intellectual elan, and sheer coruscating wit. The dialogue has a leaping, athletic energy: excitement of the mind and the heart."<br><br>"Refreshingly ambitious in its sweep...It's packed with reflections on idealism and political change that still have clout today."<br><br>"Beautiful...The meanings of the play cohere as you watch, not as narrative but as poetry, and keep growing in recollection."<br><br>"Intelligent, lucid, eloquent and enlivened by the author's wit and eye for the absurd."</p><h2>Handbook of Northwestern Plants Revised Edition</h2><p>The Handbook of Northwestern Plants has long been one of the most respected and widely used guides for identifying the plants of western Washington and Oregon. Earlier editions of this book have been used by thousands of botany students and other interested individuals to identify hundreds of different species of plants, while learning how to use analytical plant keys and the basic botanical terminology necessary to understand and accurately identify plants in the field.<p>Intended for use by teachers, students, scientists, amateur botanists, and outdoor enthusiasts, the Handbook of Northwestern Plants brings together in one comprehensive but convenient volume the information necessary to identify the amazing variety of plants found between the Cascade mountains and Pacific Coast in Washington and Oregon as far south as the Umpqua divide. The glossary of botanical terms, illustrations of different types of leaves and flowers, and hundreds of line drawings that highlight the identifying features of various plants will be especially valuable to students and beginners.</p><p>To make this new edition as accurate and up-to-date as possible, author La Rea J. Dennis has updated the nomenclature to conform to the latest scientific literature, added species, and revised some plant descriptions and keys. To make the book easier to use, the genera and species have been arranged alphabetically within families, and the longer keys have been numbered. As in earlier editions, hundreds of excellent line drawings illustrate the key characteristics of various plants.</p></p><p></p><h2>Speaking Shakespeare</h2><p><p>In <i>Speaking Shakespeare</i>, Patsy Rodenburg tackles one of the most difficult acting jobs: speaking Shakespeare's words both as they were meant to be spoken and in an understandable and dramatic way. Rodenburg calls this "a simple manual to start the journey into the heart of Shakespeare," and that is what she gives us. With the same insight she displayed in <i>The Actor Speaks</i>, Rodenburg tackles the playing of all Shakespeare's characters. She uses dramatic resonance, breathing, and placement to show how an actor can bring Hamlet, Rosalind, Puck and other characters to life. This is one book every working actor must have.</p></p><p><p><b>Patsy Rodenburg</b> is the Director of Voice at London's Royal National Theater and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. She is the author of <i>The Actor Speaks</i> (Palgrave Macmillan 2000).</p>By exploring the mechanics of Shakespeare's writing, these books clearly illustrate how to speak and understand his texts and ultimately break down the language barrier. Both cover the bard's powerful iambic pentameter and its effect on pronunciation, the irregularities that reveal the emotional and psychological state of each character, and how each word works in relation to another concerning prose, verse, blank verse, and rhyming verse. Scheeder, founder and director of the Classical Studio at New York University, and Younts, professor of the techniques of voice and text at the same institution, present a highly useful pronunciation dictionary, supplemented by a glossary that defines character names, places, and unfamiliar words. They use the International Phonetics Alphabet, respell vowels in their key to pronunciation, and intricately mark in scansion each word. When a word can be pronounced two different ways, they indicate both followed by the play, the act, and the scene in which each form is used. Rodenburg, director of voice at London's Royal National Theatre, divides her training guide into four parts, offering practical exercises that aid in comprehending the speeches that define a character's mental state and intentions. Her book uses two guideposts: the givens (including the word, the line, rhyme, and the story) and the imaginative connections necessary to make a piece engaging to both the actor and the audience. Many books exist to help actors approach Shakespeare's works, but they tend toward more general overviews. Both of these books are rich with information and nicely focused.

His main theme is the essential need to look inward, to know ourselves, in order really to understand our own&#x2014;and the world's&#x2014;conflicts. We are the world, says Krishnamurti, and it is our individual chaos that creates social disorder. He offers timeless insights into the source of true freedom and wisdom.</p><p>Krishnamurti ranks up there with Kahlil Gibran in what you might call common sense mysticism. Repudiating his upbringing as a Theosophist World Leader, Krishnamurti pushed a sort of religious self-reliance, as evidenced in the title of this collection of essays, <i>This Light in Oneself</i>. Meditation for Krishnamurti has nothing to do with gurus, postures, or concentration exercises, nor is its purpose "to sleep longer, do your job better, or to get more money." What it is can be a bit slippery, though. As Krishnamurti states it, meditation is a psychological state--a kind of choiceless awareness, "a state in which the 'me' is totally absent." His argument comes out gradually in this series of essays that are here published for the first time. But since each essay was originally a self-enclosed lecture on meditation, there is much overlap of material. So the reader must approach the book like a spaceship that circles planets and moons in order to be slingshot to further reaches. Path: unknown. Final destination: enlightenment. --<i>Brian Bruya</i>Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895&#x2013;1986) was one of the most influential spiritual teachers of the twentieth century. He traveled and lectured throughout the world until his death at the age of ninety. His talks and works are preserved in more than seventy books.</p><h2>Real Estate Transactions: Problems, Cases, and Materials (Aspen Casebook)</h2><p><p>A concise text that provides students with the tools necessary to understand real estate transactions in a real-world market setting.

This guide provides software developers with a nuts-and-bolts tutorial for writing use cases. It covers introductory, intermediate, and advanced concepts, and is suitable for all knowledge levels.</p><p>Alistair Cockburn's <i>Writing Effective Use Cases</i> is an approachable, informative, and very intelligent treatment of an essential topic of software design. "Use cases" describe how "actors" interact with computer systems and are essential to software-modeling requirements. For anyone who designs software, this title offers some real insight into writing use cases that are clear and correct and lead to better and less costly software.<p> The focus of this text is on use cases that are <i>written</i>, as opposed to modeled in UML. This book may change your mind about the advantages of writing step-by-step descriptions of the way users (or actors) interact with systems. Besides being an exceptionally clear writer, the author has plenty to say about what works and what doesn't when it comes to creating use cases. There are several standout bits of expertise on display here, including excellent techniques for finding the right "scope" for use cases. (The book uses a color scheme in which blue indicates a sea-level use case that's just right, while higher-level use cases are white, and overly detailed ones are indigo. Cockburn also provides notational symbols to document these levels of detail within a design.)</p><p> This book contains numerous tips on the writing style for use cases and plenty of practical advice for managing projects that require a large number of use cases. One particular strength lies in the numerous actual use cases (many with impressive detail) that are borrowed from real-world projects, and demonstrate both good and bad practices. Even though the author expresses a preference for the format of use cases, he presents a variety of styles, including UML graphical versions. The explanation of how use cases fit into the rest of the software engineering process is especially good. The book concludes with several dozen concrete tips for writing better use cases.</p><p> Software engineering books often get bogged down in theory. Not so in <i>Writing Effective Use Cases</i>, a slender volume with a practical focus, a concise presentation style, and something truly valuable to say. This book will benefit most anyone who designs software for a living. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered:</b> </p><ul><ol></ol></ul><table><tbody><tr><td><li>Introduction to use cases </li><li>Requirements </li><li>Usage narratives </li><li>Actors and goals </li><li>Stakeholders </li><li>Graphical models for use cases </li><li>Scope for use cases (enterprise-level through nuts-and-bolts use cases) </li><li>Primary and supporting actors </li><li>Goal levels: user goals, summary level, and subfunctions </li><li>Preconditions, triggers, and guarantees </li><li>Main success scenarios </li><li>Extensions for describing failures </li></td><td><br></td><td><li>Formats for use cases (including fully dressed one- and two-column formats) </li><li>Use case templates for five common project types </li><li>Managing use cases for large projects </li><li>CRUD use cases </li><li>Business-process modeling </li><li>Missing requirements </li><li>Moving from use cases to user-interface design </li><li>Test cases </li><li>eXtreme Programming (XP) and use cases </li><li>Sample problem use cases </li><li>Tips for writing use cases </li><li>Use cases and UML diagrams</li></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p> Writing use cases as a means of capturing the behavioral requirements of software systems and business processes is a practice that is quickly gaining popularity. Use cases provide a beneficial means of project planning because they clearly show how people will ultimately use the system being designed. On the surface, use cases appear to be a straightforward and simple concept. Faced with the task of writing a set of use cases, however, practitioners must ask: "How exactly am I supposed to write use cases?" Because use cases are essentially prose essays, this question is not easily answered, and as a result, the task can become formidable. </p> <p> In <i> <b>Writing Effective Use Cases,</b> </i> object technology expert Alistair Cockburn presents an up-to-date, practical guide to use case writing. The author borrows from his extensive experience in this realm, and expands on the classic treatments of use cases to provide software developers with a "nuts-and-bolts" tutorial for writing use cases. The book thoroughly covers introductory, intermediate, and advanced concepts, and is, therefore, appropriate for all knowledge levels. Illustrative writing examples of both good and bad use cases reinforce the author's instructions. In addition, the book contains helpful learning exercises--with answers--to illuminate the most important points. </p> <p> Highlights of the book include: </p> <ul> <li>A thorough discussion of the key elements of use cases--actors, stakeholders, design scope, scenarios, and more </li><li>A use case style guide with action steps and suggested formats </li><li>An extensive list of time-saving use case writing tips </li><li>A helpful presentation of use case templates, with commentary on when and where they should be employed </li><li>A proven methodology for taking advantage of use cases </li></ul> <p> With this book as your guide, you will learn the essential elements of use case writing, improve your use case writing skills, and be well on your way to employing use cases effectively for your next development project. </p> <br> <br> 0201702258B04062001 <p></p></p><h2>The Social Work Interview: Fifth Edition</h2><p>The only textbook to outline the skills social workers need to conduct effective client interviews, this volume synthesizes recent research on interviewing and demonstrates its value in unique settings and with a variety of clients and issues.

In addition to functioning as a teaching grammar, this work will also be widely used for reference and self-guided instruction in Hebrew beyond the first formal year. Extensive discussion and explanation of grammatical points help to sort out points blurred in introductory books. More than 3,500 Biblical Hebrew examples illustrate the points of grammar under discussion. Four indexes (Scripture, Authorities cited, Hebrew words, and Topics) provide ready access to the vast array of information found in the 40 chapters.

She has been named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by <i>Time</i>, featured on more than thirty major Japanese television and radio programs, and profiled in the <i>Sunday Times</i>, <i>Red</i> magazine, <i>You</i> magazine, the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, NPR's <i>Here &amp; Now</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>Family Circle</i>, and the <i>London&nbsp;Times, </i>who has deemed her &#x201c;Japan&#x2019;s preeminent guru of tidiness, a warrior princess in the war on clutter.&#x201d;Introduction<br><br>In this book, I have summed up how to put your space in order in a way that will change your life forever.<br><br> Impossible? A common response and not surprising, considering that almost everyone has experienced a rebound effect at least once, if not multiple times, after tidying.&nbsp;<br><br> Have <i>you</i> ever tidied madly, only to find that all too soon your home or workspace is cluttered again? If so, let me share with you the secret of success. <b>Start by discarding. Then organize your space, thoroughly, completely, in one go. </b>If you adopt this approach&#x2014;the KonMari Method&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll never revert to clutter again.<br><br> Although this approach contradicts conventional wisdom, everyone who completes my private course has successfully kept their house in order&#x2014;with unexpected results. Putting their house in order positively affects all other aspects of their lives, including work and family. Having devoted more than 80 percent of my life to this subject, I <i>know</i> that tidying can transform your life.<br><br> Does it still sound too good to be true? If your idea of tidying is getting rid of one unnecessary item a day or cleaning up your room a little at a time, then you are right. It won&#x2019;t have much effect on your life. If you change your approach, however, tidying can have an immeasurable impact. In fact, that is what it means to put your house in order.&nbsp;<br><br> I started reading home and lifestyle magazines when I was five, and it was this that inspired me, from the age of fifteen, to undertake a serious study of tidying that led to my development of the KonMari Method (based on a combination of my first and last names). I am now a consultant and spend most of my days visiting homes and offices, giving hands-on advice to people who find it difficult to tidy, who tidy but suffer rebounds, or who want to tidy but don&#x2019;t know where to start.<br><br> The number of things my clients have discarded, from clothes and undergarments to photos, pens, magazine clippings, and makeup samples, easily exceeds a million items. This is no exaggeration. I have assisted individual clients who have thrown out two hundred 45-liter <br> garbage bags in one go.<br><br> From my exploration of the art of organizing and my experience helping messy people become tidy, there is one thing I can say with confidence: <b>A dramatic reorganization of the home causes correspondingly dramatic changes in lifestyle and perspective. It is life transforming. </b>I mean it. Here are just a few of the testimonies I receive on a daily basis from former clients.<br> <i>After your course, I quit my job and launched my own business doing something I had dreamed of doing ever since I was a child.Your course taught me to see what I really need and what I don&#x2019;t. So I got a divorce. Now I feel much happier.Someone I have been wanting to get in touch with recently contacted me.I&#x2019;m delighted to report that since cleaning up my&nbsp;apartment, I&#x2019;ve been able to really increase my sales.My husband and I are getting along much better.&nbsp;I&#x2019;m amazed to find that just throwing things away has changed me so much.&nbsp;I finally succeeded in losing ten pounds.<br></i><br> My clients always sound so happy, and the results show that tidying has changed their way of thinking and their approach to life. In fact, it has changed their future. Why? This question is addressed in more detail throughout the book, but basically, <b>when you put your house in order, you put your affairs and your past in order, too. </b>As a result, you can see quite clearly what you need in life and what you don&#x2019;t, and what you should and shouldn&#x2019;t do.&nbsp;<br><br> I currently offer a course for clients in their homes and for company owners in their offices. These are all private, one-on-one consultations, but I have yet to run out of clients. There is currently a three-month waiting list, and I receive inquiries daily from people who have been introduced by a former client or who have heard about the course from someone else. I travel from one end of Japan to the other and sometimes even overseas. Tickets for one of my public talks for stay-at-home parents sold out overnight. There was a waiting list not only for cancellations but also for the waiting list. Yet my repeater rate is zero. From a business perspective, this would appear to be a fatal flaw. But what if my lack of repeaters was actually the secret to the popularity of my approach?&nbsp;<br><br> As I said at the beginning, people who use the KonMari Method never revert to clutter again. Because they can keep their space in order, they don&#x2019;t need to come back for more lessons. I occasionally check in with graduates of my courses to see how they are doing. In almost every case, not only is their home or office still in order but they are continuing to improve their space. It is evident from the photographs they send that they have even fewer belongings than when they finished the course, and have acquired new curtains and furnishings. <b>They are surrounded only by the things they love.&nbsp;<br></b><br> Why does my course transform people? Because my approach is not simply a technique. The act of tidying is a series of simple actions in which objects are moved from one place to another. It involves putting things away where they belong. This seems so simple that even a six-year-old should be able to do it. Yet most people can&#x2019;t. A short time after tidying, their space is a disorganized mess. The cause is not lack of skills but rather lack of awareness and the inability to make tidying a regular habit. In other words, the root of the problem lies in the mind. Success is 90 percent dependent on our mind-set. Excluding the fortunate few to whom organizing comes naturally, if we do not address this aspect, rebound is inevitable no matter how much is discarded or how cleverly things are organized.<br><br> So how can you acquire the right kind of mind-set? There is just one way, and, paradoxically, it is by acquiring the right technique. Remember: the KonMari Method I describe in this book is not a mere set of rules on how to sort, organize, and put things away. It is a guide to acquiring the right mind-set for creating order and becoming a tidy person.&nbsp;<br><br> Of course, I can&#x2019;t claim that all my students have perfected the art of tidying. Unfortunately, some had to stop for one reason or another before completing the course. And some quit because they expected me to do the work for them. As an organizing fanatic and professional, I can tell you right now that no matter how hard I try to organize another&#x2019;s space, no matter how perfect a storage system I devise, I can never put someone else&#x2019;s house in order in the true sense of the term. Why? Because a person&#x2019;s awareness and perspective on his or her own lifestyle are far more important than any skill at sorting, storing, or whatever. Order is dependent on the extremely personal values of what a person wants to live with.&nbsp;<br><br> Most people would prefer to live in a clean and tidy space. Anyone who has managed to tidy even once will have wished to keep it that way. But many don&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s possible. They try out various approaches to tidying only to find that things soon return to &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; I am absolutely convinced, however, that everyone can keep his or her space in order.&nbsp;<br><br> To do that, it is essential to thoroughly reassess your habits and assumptions about tidying. That may sound like far too much work, but don&#x2019;t worry. By the time you finish reading this book, you will be ready and willing. People often tell me, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m disorganized by nature,&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do it,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have time&#x201d;; but being messy is not hereditary nor is it related to lack of time. It has far more to do with the accumulation of mistaken notions about tidying, such as &#x201c;it&#x2019;s best to tackle one room at a time&#x201d; or &#x201c;it&#x2019;s better to do a little each day&#x201d; or &#x201c;storage should follow the flow plan of the house.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In Japan, people believe that things like cleaning your room and keeping your bathroom spick-and-span bring good luck, but if your house is cluttered, the effect of polishing the toilet bowl is going to be limited. The same is true for the practice of feng shui. It is only when you put your house in order that your furniture and decorations come to life.<br><br> When you&#x2019;ve finished putting your house in order, your life will change dramatically. Once you have experienced what it&#x2019;s like to have a truly ordered house, you&#x2019;ll feel your whole world brighten. Never again will you revert to clutter. This is what I call <b>the magic of tidying. </b>And the effects are stupendous. Not only will you never be messy again, but you&#x2019;ll also get a new start on life. This is the magic I want to share with as many people as possible.</p><h2>And the Wolf Finally Came: The Decline and Fall of the American Steel Industry (Pih Series in Social and Labor History)</h2><p><p>� Choice 1988 Outstanding Academic Book <br>� Named one of the Best Business Books of 1988 by USA Today</p><p>A veteran reporter of American labor analyzes the spectacular and tragic collapse of the steel industry in the 1980s.&nbsp; John Hoerr&#x2019;s account of these events stretches from the industrywide barganing failures of 1982 to the crippling work stoppage at USX (U.S. Steel) in 1986-87.&nbsp; He interviewed scores of steelworkers, company managers at all levels, and union officials, and was present at many of the crucial events he describes.&nbsp; Using historical flashbacks to the origins of the steel industry, particularly in the Monongahela Valley of southwestern Pennsylvania, he shows how an obsolete and adversarial relationship between management and labor made it impossible for the industry to adapt to shattering changes in the global economy.</p></p><p>This book reveals more about steel and some of its management and union personalities than has ever been written.

Eternal realities seemed vaguely-defined and far-removed from daily life, and conformity to the world took the form of carelessness and neglect of spiritual issues. Written by a servant of God whose preaching and writing were used to alarm and awaken many to the concerns of life and death.<br>This book was previously published by the Trust under the title <em>An Alarm to the Unconverted</em>.</p><p>Joseph Alleine (1634-1668) was born at Devizes in Wiltshire and 'set forth in the Christian race' from the age of eleven. Educated at Oxford (Lincoln and Corpus Christi) from 1649 under men such as John Owen and Thomas Goodwin, he took his BA in 1651 and became a tutor and subsequently chaplain to the College.<br><br>In 1655 Alleine accepted an invitation to become assistant to George Newton, vicar in Taunton, Somerset, and in the same year married his cousin, Theodosia. His ministry in Taunton was very fruitful until his ejection in 1662, but he continued to preach at every opportunity. His health was affected by the privations of two confinements in prison, and he died at the age of thirty-four.'If you're interested in Puritan evangelism, or just evangelism for that matter, this is one book that you have to read.

Three-star general Loren Reno practiced leadership at the highest levels in the US military. In 10 Leadership Maneuvers, Reno shares the skills that brought him success in small and large organizations, at junior and senior positions, in times of prosperity, and in times of challenge. In this personal and highly practical resource, Reno uses stories from his experience as a leader to illustrate the 10 maneuvers successful leaders use. More than a checklist or menu, these invaluable skills are useful for the aspiring leader and for those who want to elevate their leadership game. Readers will come away positioned to develop a leadership model that will help them do and think about the right things at the right times. Other key take-aways: Servants become the best leaders, and they keep serving after ascending to bigger jobs. Seeking to serve is different than just serving. Successful leaders hold themselves and others accountable. 10 Leadership Maneuvers is anchored in Scripture, and filled with the insights, principles, and never-before-heard stories of success, failure, humor, and regret of a master storyteller with exceptional leadership credentials.</p><p>Loren Reno, Lt. Gen. USAF (Ret), earned a BA in comprehensive science and education from Cedarville University,Ohio; an MS in systems management from University of Southern California; completed military and national security studies at Air University; graduate studies at Harvard University, Syracuse University, and University of North Carolina. Loren loved teaching and coaching, and his path took him to both at the highest levels, before working his way up through the ranks in the military. During 38 years in the US Air Force, he was a 5-time commander in maintenance and logistics, served in combat, and led organizations small and large, before retiring in the grade of Lieutenant General. His wife and three children followed him as he moved from the flight lines at air bases to the corridors of the Pentagon, from positions in aircraft operations and maintenance to logistics and leadership. Presently the dean of the school of business administration at his alma mater, Cedarville University, Loren loves music, reading, and traveling, and he still teaches and coaches.On December 7, 2011, I rose to pay tribute to Lieutenant General Reno on the Senate floor, calling him &#x201c;an exceptional leader, superb officer, and friend.&#x201d;&nbsp;I did not exaggerate.&nbsp;I personally worked with him during my years in the Senate. The author of&nbsp;<strong><em>10 Leadership Maneuvers</em></strong>&nbsp;is a humble man of God who has served and led with great distinction. I salute him and urge you to read this excellent book.<br> <strong>-James Inhofe, senior US senator from Oklahoma</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> This book will inspire you. It has me. I have known Lieutenant General Reno and benefitted from his wise counsel and wonderful leadership. I think you will too.<br> <strong>-Mary Fallin, 27th governor of Oklahoma; former US representative<br> &nbsp;</strong><br> Loren Reno is my friend. He and I began our work together when we were&nbsp;lieutenants and rejoined later in our careers when he was a lieutenant general. Throughout his notable tenure in our Air Force, he was a consistent and&nbsp;compelling leader of small and large organizations alike. I truly admire all he stands for and the leadership qualities he writes of and lives.<br> <strong>-Norton A. Schwartz, General, USAF&nbsp;(Ret), 19th USAF Chief of Staff</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> I first encountered Loren Reno when I worked his first Colonel assignment in the Air Force. Our friendship now spans more than two decades, and I am blessed by it. His prescriptions for effective living and leadership are what I see in his life. I was honored to make comment on his early drafts and humbled to provide some illustrations. A life well lived; a book well written. I'm grateful he shared them both with me, and now with his readers.<br> <strong>-Roger A. Brady, General, USAF (Ret), author of <em>Forget Success!!</em> and <em>Nothing Has Changed: A year of Daily Devotionals</em>.</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> I give Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Reno my complete endorsement&#x2014;to his book and to him. He is a true man of God and the leadership experience he has brought to Cedarville University has made the institution and its leaders stronger. Seeing &#x201c;serving&#x201d; as a thread running through this book is no surprise if you know the author. You&#x2019;ll want to read this cover-to-cover, and then come study with a giant example of great leadership in southwest Ohio. You won&#x2019;t regret it.<br> <strong>-Dr. Thomas White, president and professor of theology, Cedarville University</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> The leadership vacuum&nbsp;continues. Finding, developing, and training leaders is the exquisite task. Enter Lieutenant General (Ret.) Loren Reno. General Reno is a sterling example of a leader, built on a&nbsp;framework&nbsp;of integrity. His love for God's word and the military come together to explain leadership. Not only is he my friend, he has encouraged me to be a better leader. He lives what he writes and you are handling a great book.<br> <strong>-Dr. Michael Easley, teaching pastor, Fellowship Bible Church, Brentwood TN; author, radio host of <em>Michael Easley inContext</em>; former president and CEO, Moody Bible Institute</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> Loren Reno is a proven leader. When he and his family attended the church I pastor, Loren served our nation at the highest levels of military service and yet worked every Sunday in our church nursery. He&#x2019;s a leader who serves. These leadership maneuvers have been forged in the crucible of experience and time in God&#x2019;s Word. I&#x2019;m thankful he is sharing what he&#x2019;s learned with us. When a man like Loren speaks about leadership I want to listen, and you should too. I highly recommend&nbsp;<em>10 Leadership Maneuvers</em>. &nbsp;<br> <strong>-Dr. Mark Hitchcock, senior pastor, Faith Bible Church (Edmond, OK); associate professor of Bible Exposition, Dallas Theological Seminary; author of over 20 books&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</strong><br> In uniform, Loren Reno&#x2019;s leadership was respected far and wide by his peers and especially by those he led. In writing, Loren has captured three key themes that I can attest he has lived and taught:&nbsp;1) integrity in action, speech, and thought; 2) service as the foundation for leadership; and 3) humility in recognizing that the leader&#x2019;s role, as Loren&nbsp;exemplifies&nbsp;it, reflects simultaneously being a follower, leader, and child of God.&nbsp;The insights, principles, and stories in this book mark valuable pathways to effective and respectful leadership. The words are&nbsp;absolutely consistent with the Loren Reno I know, and that&#x2019;s a truly wonderful thing!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <strong>-Chris Miller, Lieutenant General, USAF (Ret.)</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> When I think of what a servant-Leader looks like, my father comes immediately to mind. Loren Reno comes right after that!&nbsp;What he shares in this book comes from the deep well of a soul that God has made beautiful. Loren writes authoritatively from a wealth of military experience&#x2014;thirty-eight years&#x2019; worth&#x2014;skillfully drawing out the biblical foundations that have shaped his amazing leadership career.<br> <strong>-Dr. Jon Young, senior pastor of Dayton Avenue Baptist Church, Xenia OH</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> Loren Reno writes like he lives and talks. In the forty-five years I&#x2019;ve known him, I have visited squadrons, groups, and centers under his command. I&#x2019;ve watched changes of command and his promotions. Lt. Gen. Reno is always ready to offer service and help to all, including wonderful honor to war veterans of all ages. Read about powerful serving and leading from a servant-leader.<br> <strong>-Dr. Clifford Johnson, WWII Army Air Corps fighter pilot</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> I want to learn leadership from one who has led others with distinction. I want to follow the person who has discovered and successfully applied timeless truths. General Loren Reno is that person. A remarkable military career has been the proving ground. <em>10 Leadership Maneuvers</em> qualifies as a lifelong literary companion.<br> <strong>-John D. Beckett, chairman of The Beckett Companies; author of <em>Loving Monday</em> and <em>Mastering Monday</em><br> &nbsp;</strong><br> Lieutenant General (Ret.) Loren Reno is the personification of the term servant-leader. I have learned from his example and his wisdom for over thirty-five years, and I have seen firsthand the tremendous impact of the leadership principles so aptly described in his book. This is a personal and extremely practical leadership aid. Young leaders will be refreshed herein by proven insight and spurred on to excellence in serving and leading.<br> <strong>-William A.

Hagio is one of Japan&#x2019;s most influential and critically lauded comics innovators; she has been reinventing shojo manga (Japanese comics marketed at 10-18 year-old girls) since 1969. Unconstrained by boundaries of genre, she has sculpted a career characterized by intellectual curiosity, psychological authenticity, and an esthetic sense that has elevated the shojo genre into the literary. In &#x201c;Autumn Journey&#x201d; (1971), a boy&#x2019;s pilgrimage to the home of his favorite author has more meaning than either the author or his daughter can imagine. In &#x201c;Marie, Ten Years Later&#x201d; (1977), two estranged friends learn too late how their actions had destroyed the balance of a perfect triad of intimacy. In &#x201c;A Drunken Dream&#x201d; (1980), two scientists&#x2014;one a hermaphrodite, the other a tribal priest&#x2014;meet on a space station orbiting Io; but they have met before and are destined to meet again. In &#x201c;Iguana Girl&#x201d; (1991), a girl who appears to her mother and herself to be a hideous anthropoid iguana struggles to overcome her mother&#x2019;s rejection and find happiness ... but her mother has a secret. Learn for yourself why the creator of They Were Eleven! (adapted into an anime released on DVD in 2005) continues to garner international critical praise and appeals to readers across ages and generations. <br></p><p><p><strong>Moto Hagio</strong> was born in 1949 and lives in Japan. She is widely considered the most beloved shojo manga artist of all time. She is the winner of the 2006 Japanese equivalent of the Nebula Award.</p><p><strong>Matt Thorn</strong> is from in Lansdale, Pennsylvania. She is a cultural anthropologist, writer, and an associate professor in the manga department at Kyoto Seika University. Her translations include the <em>New York Times</em> Best-Seller <em>Nijigahara Holograph</em> by Inio Asano and Hayao Miyazaki&#x2019;s <em>Nausica� of the Valley of the Wind</em>.</p>*Starred Review* Once the folks at Fantagraphics decided to dip their toes in the manga pool, they didn&#x2019;t mess around, choosing to launch their new manga line with this collection of short stories from one of the most influential creators of manga for women. Not a retrospective of a waning master, the book instead showcases a career four decades in the making that remains vibrant and relevant today. Hagio&#x2019;s stories are infused with dark emotions&#x2014;longing, jealousy, remorse&#x2014;that are instantly identifiable and, hence, often uncomfortable to confront. The stories are collected in chronological order, affording a glimpse of how Hagio&#x2019;s storytelling abilities have matured, from the melancholic shojo romances of the 1970s (&#x201c;Autumn Journey&#x201d;) to the gender-bending sci-fi from the 1980s (&#x201c;A Drunken Dream&#x201d;) to the powerhouse introspective character studies from recent years (&#x201c;Iguana Girl,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Willow Tree&#x201d;). Two articles written by manga scholar Matt Thorn are also included: an overview of Hagio&#x2019;s career and place among &#x201c;The Magnificent Forty-Niners&#x201d; and an interview with Hagio in which she discusses her work, her life, and how the two intersect. It isn&#x2019;t often that a book&#x2019;s back matter is as fascinating as the stories it supports, but Hagio&#x2019;s openness illuminates the stories in a way mere commentary never could. Although many of the stories included in this volume were ostensibly written for young adults, and may indeed be enjoyed by teens interested in literary manga, this topflight collection will likely resonate most with adult readers. --Eva Volin</p><h2>Dead Man&#39;s Chest (Phryne Fisher Mysteries, 18)</h2><p><p><em><strong>Dot unfolded the note. "He says that his married couple will look after the divine Miss Fisher...I'll leave out a bit...their name is Johnson and they seem very reliable." Phryne got the door open at last.

She'd promised everyone a nice holiday by the sea with absolutely no murders, but when they arrive at their rented accommodation that doesn't seem likely at all.</p><p>An empty house, a gang of teenage louts, a fisherboy saved, and a missing butler and his wife seem to lead inexorably toward a hunt for buried treasure by the sea. Phryne knows to what depths people will sink for greed, but with a glass of champagne in one hand and a pearl-handled Beretta in the other, no one is getting past her.</p></p><p><p>Kerry Greenwood was born in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray and after wandering far and wide, she returned to live there. She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>After some rather harrowing adventures (Murder on a Midsummer Night, 2009) Phryne Fisher, the Australian flapper and PI, is determined to enjoy a quiet vacation. After packing maid Dot, adopted daughters Jane and Ruth, and cat Molly into her Hispano Suiza, Phryne drives to Queenscliff, only to discover that the rental house is missing its butler and housekeeper. Then, despite her desire for a murder-free vacation, she takes on an investigation after the missing housekeeper&#x2019;s beloved dog shows up on her backstep, filthy and hungry, and the local coppers prove to be no help. Phryne&#x2019;s determination to get it all wrapped up before boyfriend Lin Chung joins her makes for a fast-paced story. Greenwood weaves in a local legend involving pirates and missing treasure, and Phryne makes friends with some wacky surrealists in this very enjoyable eighteenth series entry. A major new character is introduced as Phryne welcomes into the family a young man who proves a willing and capable assistant investigator. The limited cast of characters (most of Phryne&#x2019;s regulars stay in Melbourne) makes this a good choice for series newcomers. --Jessica Moyer</p><h2>Exchanging Our Country Marks: The Transformation of African Identities in the Colonial and Antebellum South</h2><p>The transatlantic slave trade brought individuals from diverse African regions and cultures to a common destiny in the American South. In this comprehensive study, Michael Gomez establishes tangible links between the African American community and its African origins and traces the process by which African populations exchanged their distinct ethnic identities for one<br>defined primarily by the conception of race. He examines transformations in the politics, social structures, and religions of slave populations through 1830, by which time the contours of a new African American identity had begun to emerge.<br><p><br>After discussing specific ethnic groups in Africa, Gomez follows their movement to North America, where they tended to be amassed in recognizable concentrations within individual colonies (and, later, states). For this reason, he argues, it is possible to identify particular ethnic cultural influences and ensuing social formations that heretofore have been considered unrecoverable. Using sources pertaining to the African continent<br>as well as runaway slave advertisements, ex-slave narratives, and folklore, Gomez reveals concrete and specific links between particular African populations and their North American progeny, thereby shedding new light on subsequent African American social formation.<br><br></p></p><p>With its legacy of brutality and of the horrific overseas passage, the transatlantic slave trade may be imagined as the kidnapping of Africans without regard to nationality or ethnicity. Based on his research, however, Michael A. Gomez suggests that Africans, upon arriving in America, were dispersed much more closely along ethnic and cultural lines than previously acknowledged. The underlying theme of his provocative work, <i>Exchanging Our Country Marks</i>, is that while blacks eventually replaced their African ethnic identities with new racial ones after arriving in the American South, they retained much of their original cultures far longer than was originally suspected. Some of his most interesting evidence of this comes in the form of runaway-slave advertisements, which identified the slaves by their ethnic roots ("Dinah, an Ebo wench that speaks very good English"). By scrutinizing ex-slave narratives, stories, music, and even the location and nature of slave rebellions, Gomez pieces together a genealogy of blacks in the American South, attempting to examine their notions of identity. Of course, much is based on significant speculation, a fact that only underscores the difficulty of such scholarship. Gomez manages to present a wide range of information clearly as he expands on a wealth of recent research regarding the slave trade and the history of blacks in America, making <i>Exchanging Our Country Marks</i> a vast and creative exploration of African identity in the United States from 1526 to 1830."Every so often an essentially synthetic work appears that is more than a synthesis. <i>Exchanging Our Country Marks</i> by Michael A. Gomez is such a book. Although it relies heavily on secondary sources reinforced by extensive research in runaway slave advertisements in southern newspapers and WPA interviews from the 1930s, <i>Exchanging Our Country Marks</i> is a conceptual <i>tour de force</i>. No brief review can do justice to the nuances and complexities of Gomez's argument. . . . A fully satisfying work that engages the heart as well as the mind."-- <i>Southern Cultures</i> <br></p><h2>The Hunt: A Novel (Predator Trilogy)</h2><p>Touched by a killer, she feels the fire of revenge.<br><br>Twelve years ago, Miranda Moore miraculously survived the torture of a serial killer who was never caught.

He pinched the bridge of his nose, swallowing anger so bitter he could taste it. The foul stench of death surrounded him and he turned away.<br><br>He still pictured the dead, broken body of twenty-year-old Rebecca Douglas as he&#x2019;d found her only an hour ago.<br><br>&#x201c;Sheriff?&#x201d;<br><br>Nick looked up as Deputy Lance Booker approached. He was clean-cut, a good cop, though a mite wet behind the ears. Much like Nick had been twelve years ago when he&#x2019;d been called out to his first murder scene. &#x201c;Deputy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jim said there&#x2019;s a guy claiming to be an FBI agent at the road wanting to be let through. Quincy Peterson.&#x201d;<br><br>Quinn. Nick hadn&#x2019;t seen him in years, ten to be exact, but they&#x2019;d shared an e-mail relationship since he was elected sheriff more than three years ago. After the Croft sisters had been found.<br><br>Now there were seven dead girls. Seven that they knew about.<br><br>&#x201c;Let him through.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Booker frowned, but relayed the orders through his walkie-talkie. In matters that would as a rule fall under their local jurisdiction, no law officer welcomed outside interference, and usually Nick was no different. He didn&#x2019;t mention that it was his call to Quinn last week that precipitated this visit.<br><br>Nick turned and walked away from the deputy, away from the bright tarp, down the path to where Rebecca Douglas&#x2019;s last steps were evident. He squatted next to an unusable footprint, a mess in wet, hardening mud. It might have been Rebecca&#x2019; s last step. Or the killer&#x2019;s. It had rained nearly three inches in the last two days, a deluge that saturated a ground recently recovered from a cold, wet Montana winter. The clouds had broken this morning, the sky such a vivid blue and the air so refreshing that Nick would have enjoyed it if he hadn&#x2019;t been called to a crime scene.<br><br>He closed his eyes and breathed the clean, crisp air of his Gallatin Valley. He loved Montana, the vast beauty and sheer majesty of its mountains, its swift rivers, green valleys, big sky. The people were good, too, down-to-earth. They cared about their neighbors, took care of their own. When Rebecca Douglas was declared missing, hundreds of men and women&#x2014;many from the university where she&#x2019;d been a student&#x2014;had scoured the wilderness between Bozeman and Yellowstone looking for her.<br><br>Nick&#x2019;s jaw tightened in restrained fury. Good people, but for one. One who had killed Rebecca and at least six other women in the past fifteen years. And other women were still missing. Would they ever find their bodies? Had the harsh Montana weather or four-legged animals obliterated their remains? He&#x2019;d never forget finding Penny Thompson&#x2019;s remains&#x2014;nothing but a skull and scattered bones. She was identified through her dental records.<br><br>Nick surveyed the area. Tall pines grew primarily downslope; as the mountain rose the trees thinned out. The ancient, heavily overgrown road he&#x2019;d driven on was unmapped. Possibly an old logging trail, it appeared to end here, in this natural clearing roughly thirty feet square. On the edge of this clearing, Rebecca&#x2019;s body lay.<br><br>They&#x2019;d mark off the area in grids and search for anything that might possibly lead back to the killer. But if it was the same bastard, they&#x2019;d find nothing. He was so damn perfect in his every crime that even their one surviving witness could tell them little. Defeat weighed heavily in Nick&#x2019;s heart, but he would not give up.<br><br>Sometimes, he hated his job.<br><br>He turned when he heard an SUV roll into the clearing, rocks and muddy clumps of leaves shooting out from the backs of all four tires. Sun reflected off the windshield and Nick shielded his eyes to watch Quinn approach.<br><br>The SUV jerked to a stop behind Nick&#x2019;s dark green police-issue truck. The driver&#x2019;s door opened and Quincy Peterson jumped out, slamming the door behind him and striding toward Nick. Quinn hadn&#x2019;t changed much since Nick had last seen him, still looked more like a damn cover model than a fifteen-year veteran of the FBI. Nick stood and absently brushed the dirt off his jeans.<br><br>&#x201c;Rebecca Douglas?&#x201d; Quinn nodded toward the covered body. His face was blank, but his dark eyes revealed the same anger and sadness that Nick felt.<br><br>&#x201c;Yep. We&#x2019;ll need a positive ID, but&#x2014;&#x201d; There was no doubt it was the missing woman. He glanced at Quinn and raised an eyebrow at the bandage over his left eye. &#x201c;Bar fight?&#x201d; he asked, half joking.<br><br>Quinn reached up and touched the bandage as if he&#x2019;d forgotten it was there. &#x201c;The last few days have been eventful,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you about it later.&#x201d; He glanced around. &#x201c;When are you processing the scene?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wanted you to check it out first, but I have my men waiting up on the main highway.&#x201d;<br><br>Nick didn&#x2019;t know why the Fed made him feel so inferior. Maybe it had something to do with Quinn&#x2019;s quiet confidence, his knack for seeing through bullshit, always getting to the heart of the matter. Or maybe it was because Nick had puked his guts out at his first murder scene and Quincy Peterson hadn&#x2019;t.<br><br>Or maybe it was because the woman Nick loved was in love with Quinn.<br><br>Despite all that, there was no one Nick trusted more than Special Agent Quincy Peterson.<br><br>Quinn bent down, pulled on latex gloves, and lifted the tarp. His square jaw clenched and a vein twitched in his neck at the sight.<br><br>Rebecca had been beautiful. Now, her long blonde hair was tangled, matted, and caked in mud. The happy face reproduced on thousands of flyers was gone. She was swollen, bruised, grotesque in death. The recent rains had cleaned some of the dirt from her naked body, leaving her pale and blue.<br><br>Her neck had been cut, slashed deep with a sharp knife, though there was very little blood to see. Most of it had been washed into the ground by the storm, along with any trace evidence. Her body showed signs of abuse. Torture. Bruises of all shapes and hues of purple covered her skin. Her breasts had been clamped into some sort of vise. The strange marks wouldn&#x2019;t have indicated that to most eyes, but both Nick and Quinn had read the coroner&#x2019;s reports for each of the six other women murdered in these woods, and had grown familiar with this killer&#x2019;s M.O.<br><br>Quinn removed the tarp to study the victim&#x2019;s legs and feet, much as Nick had done when he first arrived on scene. Her left leg was crooked, broken. Her feet were covered in raw blisters and deep cuts. From running.<br><br>She was thin, so pale, empty. Clinically, her gaunt skin told the cops that she&#x2019;d bled out, her life drained from her. She&#x2019;d died quickly; nobody could survive long with their carotid artery sliced open. Small consolation for the previous week of terror she&#x2019;d lived through.<br><br>Quinn covered the body. &#x201c;Coroner been called?&#x201d;<br><br>Nick nodded. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be out by noon. He was in the middle of an autopsy on that hiker we found up on the north ridge the other day.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So who found the body?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Three boys&#x2014;the McClain brothers and Ryan Parker. The Parkers have a spread three, four miles west of here. The boys took a couple horses for the day, were going to shoot their .22s at rabbits and whatnot.&#x201d; He shrugged and added, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Saturday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where are they now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A deputy took them home. Told them to sit tight at the Parkers&#x2019; until I came by.&#x201d;<br><br>Quinn nodded, surveying the scene that Nick had marked with yellow and black crime scene tape. Observing the clearing, the old path, the trees.<br><br>&#x201c;It looks like she came up through that brush over there,&#x201d; Nick gestured. &#x201c;I checked it out, but didn&#x2019;t go down the trail yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you can call it a trail,&#x201d; Quinn said, frowning at the overgrowth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take a quick look while you call in your team. How many people do you have?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I have a dozen of my own men right now, more later, and a crime scene specialist. I&#x2019;ll need volunteers if we&#x2019;re going to do this right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Agreed. The more eyes the better, but no hotshots. We can&#x2019;t have someone going off half-cocked.&#x201d;<br><br>Quinn put his hand on Nick&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;I know you were hoping the bastard dropped dead after Ellen and Elaine Croft were found. I&#x2019;m sorry I couldn&#x2019;t come out personally then. But Agent Thorne is good. She would have found something.&#x201d;<br><br>Nick agreed, but he still felt so damn helpless. The Butcher was the only bastard who had ever gotten away with murder under his watch. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been three frickin&#x2019; years! Three years since he killed. And we had nothing then&#x2014;no clues, no leads, no suspects.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And there are other girls missing.&#x201d; Quinn didn&#x2019;t need to remind him. The missing girls haunted Nick in his sleep.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been slow, but we&#x2019;re gathering evidence,&#x201d; Quinn continued. &#x201c;We have casings, bullets, a partial from Elaine Croft&#x2019; s locket. We&#x2019;ll get him.&#x201d; Quinn turned and Nick watched him walk down the path. He sounded so confident. Why couldn&#x2019;t Nick feel the same?<br><br>He glanced down at the outline of Rebecca Douglas. At least she would have a proper burial. Closure for her family. But not for him.<br><br>He thought of Miranda.<br><br>He started toward his truck. He&#x2019;d already put in the call for all available law enforcement to head to this location. Then he heard the unique but familiar sound of a Jeep bouncing over the rough trail. He didn&#x2019;t need to see the vehicle to know who approached.<br><br>&#x201c;Damn.&#x201d;<br><br>The red Jeep jerked to a stop behind Peterson&#x2019;s rental. Almost before the truck halted, Miranda Moore jumped out, the mud no match for her heavy boots and confident stride. Deputy Booker approached her, and she glared at him without stopping as she pulled a red down-filled vest over her black flannel shirt. In any other situation, Nick would have grinned at the way Booker backed off.<br><br>Then she focused her sharp blue eyes on him.<br><br>His heart quickened and his stomach lurched. If only he&#x2019;d had more time to prepare for her inevitable arrival. If he&#x2019;d been warned she was on her way, he could have steeled himself for the confrontation.<br><br>&#x201c;Miranda,&#x201d; he said as she approached, &#x201c;I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Damn you, Nick!&#x201d; She poked a finger at his chest. &#x201c;Damn you!&#x201d; Nothing intimidated Miranda. Though she was tall for a woman&#x2014;at least five-foot-nine&#x2014;he had six inches and a hundred pounds on her. You&#x2019;d think he&#x2019;d intimidate her, that any man would frighten her after what she&#x2019; d gone through, but he guessed he shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised. She was a survivor. She didn&#x2019;t expose her fear.<br><br>&#x201c;Miranda, I was going to call you. I didn&#x2019;t know for certain it was Rebecca. I didn&#x2019;t want you to have to go through it again.&#x201d;<br><br>Her darkening eyes told him she didn&#x2019;t believe him. &#x201c;Screw that. Screw you! You promised you&#x2019;d call.&#x201d; She brushed past him and strode over to the tarp, staring at the covered body. Her fists clenched, her shoulders reverberated in tension.<br><br>Nick wanted to stop her, to protect her from seeing another dead girl. Most of all, he wanted to protect her from herself.<br><br>And she&#x2019;d always been perfectly clear that she didn&#x2019;t want Nick&#x2019;s protection.<br><br>Miranda worked to control her temper. She shouldn&#x2019;t have yelled at Nick, but dammit! He&#x2019;d promised. For seven days she&#x2019;d been searching for Rebecca, the nightmares destroying the few hours of sleep she allowed herself. He&#x2019;d promised she&#x2019;d be the first to know when they found her.<br><br>Neither she nor Nick had expected to find Rebecca alive.<br><br>She stared at the sunny tarp in the middle of the quiet earth tones of the land and inhaled sharply, her throat raw with hot anger and unwanted ice-cold fear. Her fists squeezed into tight balls, her nails digging into her palms. She knew it was Rebecca Douglas. But she had to see for herself, force herself to look at the Butcher&#x2019;s latest victim. For strength, for courage.<br><br>For vengeance.<br><br>She pulled latex gloves over her long fingers, knelt beside the still woman, and fingered the edge of the tarp. &#x201c;Rebecca,&#x201d; she said, her voice a whisper, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re not alone. I promise you I&#x2019;ll find him. He&#x2019;ll pay for what he did to you.&#x201d;<br><br>She swallowed, hesitated, then drew back the tarp to reveal the girl she&#x2019;d been searching for, twenty hours a day for the last week.<br><br>At first, Miranda didn&#x2019;t see the swollen face, the slit throat, or the many cuts washed clean by the rain. The image of the twenty-year-old in Miranda&#x2019;s mind was beautiful, as she had been when she was alive.<br><br>Rebecca had a contagious laugh, according to her best friend, Candi. Rebecca cared about those less fortunate and volunteered one night a week reading to the infirm at Deaconess, according to her career counselor, Ron Owens. A straight-A student, Rebecca had wanted to be a veterinarian, according to her biology teacher, Greg Marsh.<br><br>Rebecca hadn&#x2019;t been perfect. But no one had shared the less attractive stories while she&#x2019;d been missing.<br><br>No one would ever repeat them now that she was dead.<br><br>As Miranda watched, the image of Rebecca she&#x2019;d held so close to her heart during the hours and hours of searching morphed into the broken body before her.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019; re free,&#x201d; she told her. &#x201c;Free at last.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Sharon. I&#x2019;m so sorry.</i><br><br>&#x201c;No one can hurt you anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>She reached over and touched Rebecca&#x2019;s hair, brushed a matted piece to the side, cupped her cheek.<br><br><i>Stay in control.</i></p><h2>25 Books Every Christian Should Read: A Guide to the Essential Spiritual Classics (A Renovare Resource)</h2><p><p>From the creators of <em>Devotional Classics</em> and <em>Spiritual Classics</em> comes <em>25 Books Every Christian Should Read</em>, the definitive guide to the most spiritually influential and important books for Christians to read.

Something we&#x2019;ve turned a blind eye to for far too long. Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a pediatrician, professor, and world-renowned researcher, tells the story of how our everyday surroundings are making us sicker, fatter, and poorer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dr. Trasande exposes the chemicals that disrupt our hormonal systems and damage our health in irreparable ways. He shows us where these chemicals hide&#x2014;in our homes, our schools, at work, in our food, and countless other places we can&#x2019;t control&#x2014;as well as the workings of policy that protects the continued use of these chemicals in our lives. Drawing on extensive research and expertise, he outlines dramatic studies and emerging evidence about the rapid increases in neurodevelopmental, metabolic, reproductive, and immunological diseases directly related to the hundreds of thousands of chemicals that we are exposed to every day. Unfortunately, nowhere is safe.<br> &nbsp;<br> But, thanks to Dr. Trasande&#x2019;s work on the topic, and his commitment to effecting change, this book can help. Through a blend of narrative, scientific detective work, and concrete information about the connections between chemicals and disease, he shows us what we can do to protect ourselves and our families in the short-term, and how we can help bring the change we deserve.&nbsp;</p><p>Leonardo Trasande, MD, MPP is a tenured associate professor in pediatrics, environmental medicine, and population health at the NYU School of Medicine, in health policy at the NYU Wagner School of Public Service, and at the NYU College of Global Public Health. Dr. Trasande&#39;s research focuses on identifying the role of environmental exposures in childhood obesity and cardiovascular risks, and documenting the economic costs for policy makers of failing to proactively prevent diseases of environmental origin in children.</p><h2>The Authentic Letters of Paul</h2><p>There were four different portraits of Paul in the early church: the non-authoritarian Paul of the great Letters, the authoritarian, misogynist Paul of the Pastoral Epistles, the frenetic missionary who single-handedly introduced Christianity to the Mediterranean world, and the proto- Gnostic Paul of Marcion and the Gnostic commentaries on Paul s letters. Which is the real Paul? The Christian church opted for the Pastoral Epistles, and so read Paul letters through that lens. But that image has become so problematic in the modern world that many contemporary readers are either put off by Paul or simply ignore him. But was Paul really such a frightful figure? In providing a fresh reading of Paul s authentic letters, the SV translators have attempted to liberate his words from those of Augustine, and later Martin Luther, who used Paul to cover their own guilty consciences. This Augustinian-Lutheran tradition of interpreting Paul s discourses about justification by faith as a way of dealing with their own sense of moral failure, for instance, represents but one way of translating Paul s letters. The Greek of Paul s writings can be understood rather differently so that Paul s message is not about personal guilt, but about the trustworthiness of God, and Jesus courageous faith in God as a role model for others. This is how Paul s letters are translated in this book. Here readers will encounter a very different view of Paul and his message.</p><p>A magnificent book! The authors, four Jesus Seminar Fellows, combine their brilliant scholarship with a clear and readable prose to present Paul s thought to our day with a vibrant freshness. In the process they free Paul from the creeds and doctrines that have for so long distorted his message. This is the best book on Paul I have ever read. --John Shelby Spong, Episcopal Bishop Emeritus of Newark, New Jersey<br><br>Were the 13 letters in the New Testament ascribed to Paul s hand really written by Paul? Even in the letters that can be considered his, are there interpolations from a later hand that changed them significantly? In this brilliant new translation and introduction to Paul and his writings, the translators all fellows of the Jesus Seminar of scholars concerned with biblical authenticity attempt to answer these questions and to provide a dynamic rendering of Paul s letters that takes account of the mythic register of his language and the rhetorical flourishes of his style. They conclude that the extant authentic Pauline letters are 1 Thessalonians, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Philemon, Philippians, and Romans, and these letters were likely written around the middle of the first century. In addition, the translators point out interpolations from later hands in the authentic letters, such as 1 Corinthians 13 (the famous love chapter). The translators arrange the letters in the chronological order in which they were most likely written. Given the exalted status of Paul and his writings, this exceptional new translation is sure to shatter some views of Paul s letters. --Publishers Weekly<br><br>In The Authentic Letters of Paul, Dewey, Hoover, McGaughy, and Schmidt have given us one of the most deeply satisfying Christian reads of recent time. Paul and Pauline literature have rarely been so accessibly, judiciously, and cordially presented as they are here, much less so beneficially. This is a work to be savored and pondered, employed, shared and, ultimately, praised. --Phyllis Tickle, Publishers Weekly</p><h2>Texaco: A Novel</h2><p>"Chamoiseau is a writer who has the sophistication of the modern novelist, and it is from that position (as an heir of Joyce and Kafka) that he holds out his hand to the oral prehistory of literature."<br>--Milan Kundera<br><br>Of black Martinican provenance, Patrick Chamoiseau gives us <i>Texaco</i> (winner of the Prix Goncourt, France's most prestigious literary prize), an international literary achievement, tracing one hundred and fifty years of post-slavery Caribbean history: a novel that is as much about self-affirmation engendered by memory as it is about a quest for the adequacy of its own form.<br><br>In a narrative composed of short sequences, each recounting episodes or developments of moment, and interspersed with extracts from fictive notebooks and from statements by an urban planner, Marie-Sophie Laborieux, the saucy, aging daughter of a slave affranchised by his master, tells the story of the tormented foundation of her people's identity. The shantytown established by Marie-Sophie is menaced from without by hostile landowners and from within by the volatility of its own provisional state. Hers is a brilliant polyphonic rendering of individual stories informed by rhythmic orality and subversive humor that shape a collective experience.<br><br>A joyous affirmation of literature that brings to mind Boccaccio, La Fontaine, Lewis Carroll, Montaigne, Rabelais, and Joyce, <i>Texaco</i> is a work of rare power and ambition, a masterpiece.</p><p>In <i>Texaco</i>, Patrick Chamoiseau is not scared of reimagining history in order to illuminate an essential truth about his homeland, Martinique. Through his narrator, Marie-Sophie Laborieux, a daughter of slaves, he chronicles 150 years in the history of Martinique, starting with the birth of Marie-Sophie's beloved father, Esternome, on a sugar plantation sometime in the early 19th century. It ends with her founding Texaco, a shanty town built on the grounds of an old oil refinery on the outskirts of Fort-de-France. What happens in-between is an astounding flight of imagination and language that rivals the works of Salman Rushdie, Ben Okri and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. <p> Chamoiseau begins in the present with the arrival of an urban planner, whom the residents of Texaco mistake for Christ. It then spins back in time to the birth of Esternome and the death of his father, who was suspected of witchcraft by a white plantation owner. In myriad short sequences, the novel follows Esternome's progress as he is first freed by his master, then drawn away from the plantation by the lure of St. Pierre--"City" in the minds of the disenfranchised black population of Martinique. He is eventually washed up on the outskirts of Fort-de-France, which becomes "City" after St. Pierre is destroyed by a volcanic eruption. With the birth of Marie-Sophie, Chamoiseau takes the reader into the present century--through two world wars, riots, famine, political turmoil. The tension always simmers between "City," a metaphor for France, and the countryside where black Martinique's collective consciousness resides.</p>Patrick Chamoiseau produces a mythic history of the Creole nation that arose from the forced marriage of French and African peoples in his native Martinique. The chief spokeswoman for that nation is the indomitable and profanely wise Marie-Sophie Laborieux, the founder of Texaco, a teeming shantytown poised on the edge of a city that constantly threatens to engulf it. Now Marie-Sophie is Texaco&#39;s protectress as well. For only she can dissuade an urban planner from ordering her anarchic quarter razed to the ground. Like Scheherazade before her, she relies on stories - stories of slaves and sorcerers, thugs and courtesans, uprisings and eruptions.</p><h2>The Mating Season</h2><p>The Mating Season is a time of love, mistaken identity, and mishap for Bertie, Gussie Fink-Nottle and other guests staying at Deverill Hall-luckily there&#39;s unflappable Jeeves to set things right.</p><p>Fans of P.G.

He is the author of many nonfiction books and his writing has appeared in venues such as Art in America, the Caf� Irreal, Confrontation, Communication Arts, Family Circle, Glamour, Guernica, the Nation, and Writer&#39;s Digest. The founder and publisher of Allworth Press, he lives in New York City.This is the fifth edition of Legal Guide for the Visual Artist. The book has a broad scope and uses "visual artist" to include cartoonists, craftspeople, graphic designers, illustrators, painters, photographers, printmakers, sculptors, and textile designers. All of the people in these categories are artists, and all need and will benefit from the information offered in this book.<br><br>What I find remarkable in looking back to 1977 when I wrote the first edition of Legal Guide is how legal protections have expanded for artists and how technology has changed the way in which information, including the information contained in art, can be processed and disseminated to the public. The text will elaborate these themes, but certainly the passage of the Visual Artists Rights Act and the rapid evolution of digital technologies are dramatic examples of the legal and technological changes affecting artists.<br><br>Art law, although drawn from many areas of the law, has developed more and more into a distinct entity over the last fifty years. Legal Guide for the Visual Artist seeks to introduce artists to the legal issues of both art in commerce and artists' rights. It deals with each of the sequence of issues that begin as soon as the artist contemplates creating a work of art, including copyright, contracts of all types, taxes, estate planning, and public support for artists.<br><br>Action in the legal sphere may appear to be an anomaly for the artist involved with creative work. Perhaps, as Carl Andre suggests, the artist should seek to withdraw from the art world and the dangers of success. Yet the artist seeking to earn his or her living from an art career must focus on art as commerce, what Andy<br>Warhol calls being "a business artist." <br><br>All artists, whether they agree with Carl Andre or Andy Warhol, must be capable of resolving business and legal issues. In this respect, a greater familiarity with art law and other sources of support will help the artist. Artists should never feel intimidated, helpless, or victimized. Legal and business considerations exist from the moment an artist conceives a work or receives an assignment. While no handbook can solve the unique problems of each artist, the artist's increased awareness of the general legal issues pertaining to art will aid in avoiding risks and gaining benefits that might otherwise pass unnoticed.<br><br>Artists' Groups<br>Artists' groups provide a valuable support network. There are too many of these groups across the country to mention each by name, but those with a special interest in artists' rights, including legal and business issues, are listed in the Appendix on pages 251-257.<br><br>Many of the groups offer newsletters and other information services of value to their members.<br>A few provide legal services, while others lobby for legislation favorable to artists. Health, life, and even automobile insurance are frequently offered at group rates. Some of the groups promote art by sponsoring shows, publishing books, or maintaining slide registries of art.<br><br>Within the boundaries of the antitrust laws, certain groups publish surveys to help members determine fair pricing practices. A number of the groups have codes of ethics, which dictate standards for both business and art practices in the profession.<br><br>Joining an artists' group can be an important step for an artist in terms of protecting rights and advancing his or her professional prestige.<br><br>Lawyers for the Arts<br>The search for a lawyer is often time-consuming and disheartening. Not only are fees high, but many lawyers are not knowledgeable about the issues encountered by artists. Standard techniques for finding a lawyer include asking a friend who consulted a lawyer for a similar problem, calling a local bar association's referral service, or going to a legal clinic. All of these approaches have merits, but today the artist may be able to locate a knowledgeable lawyer with far greater precision.<br><br>The very definition of an area of the law as "art law" is an encouraging sign for the expertise lawyers will bring to the artist's problems. The literature and educational programs for lawyers have vastly increased. Many law schools now offer art-law courses and bar associations are paying greater attention to art and the artist. The Selected Bibliography shows how many art-law books are now available for lawyers.<br><br>Equally encouraging are the lawyers across the country volunteering to help needy artists. Both volunteer lawyers' groups and artists' groups, several of which maintain rosters of attorneys who will help members at a reduced fee, are good resources to use when seeking a lawyer with art-law expertise. Such referrals may result in finding lawyers who either do not charge or work at more affordable rates.

Knight (1874&#x2013;1953), the acknowledged master of animal drawing and the man who <i>American Biographies</i> agrees "was generally recognized as the most distinguished painter of animal life." Those who have seen his murals, paintings, and bronzes of both prehistoric and modern animals in the New York Museum of Natural History or any one of a dozen other major zoological museums know why his work is so highly regarded. His animal portrayals are startlingly alive with beauty, virility, charm, power, and expression. He seems to have caught animals in the very act of feeding, stalking, resting, or in any one of the thousands of completely natural attitudes that animals assume. <br>In this book, which is an extensive course in animal drawing, Knight offers an almost incredible wealth of practical instruction to commercial and fine artists, painters, sculptors, book illustrators, designers, decorators, and art students. He discusses animal musculature, bone structure, animal psychology, movements, habits, and habitats. He provides innumerable tips on animal proportions, the play of light and shadow, coloring, hair formation, feather arrangements of birds, scales of fish, how animals lie down, animal expressions, how a lioness bends back her ears when angry, and many others. Scores of animal categories are covered: great apes, tigers, lions, dogs, bears, cattle, horses, antelopes, sheep, goats, camels, swine, seals, rodents, young animals, exotic animals, crocodiles, snakes, fish, and birds. <br>This work should help both practicing artists and art students achieve more natural and lifelike drawings. Especially valuable will be the many pointers on how to avoid stiffness and gracelessness in drawings of horses, deer, and other quick-footed animals; how to introduce the proper sense of bulk and power in sketches of such heavier animals as elephants and bears; and how to put into drawings of the cat family, from the household pet to the African lion, the superb lithe grace and wealth of subtle expression that we marvel at in the originals.</p><p></p><h2>The Macho Paradox: Why Some Men Hurt Women and How All Men Can Help (How to End Domestic Violence, Mental and Emotional Abuse, and Sexual Harassment)</h2><p>Praise for The Macho Paradox<br><br>"An honest, intellectually rigorous and insightful work that challenges readers to truly engage in a political discourse that can change lives, communities and nations."<br><br>--Rosalind Wiseman, author of Queen Bees and Wannabes<br><br>"Jackson Katz is an American hero!

He is cofounder of the Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) program at Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sports in Society. MVP is most widely used in college athletics, and is also used by both the 2005 Super Bowl champion New England Patriots and the 2004 World Series champion Boston Red Sox. Katz also directs the first worldwide gender violence prevention program in the history of the United States Marine Corps. His award-winning educational video Tough Guide, his featured appearance in the films Wrestling with Manhood and Spin the Bottle, and his nationwide lectures have brought his insights into masculinity and gender violence to millions of college and high school students. Since 1990, he has lectured at over nine hundred colleges, prep schools, high schools, middle schools, professional conferences, and military institutions in forty-three states. A native of Boston, he lives with his family in the Los Angeles area. For more information see www.jacksonkatz.com.<br>Katz is cofounder of the Mentors in Violence Prevention Program (MVP), and his focus is on prevention&#x2014;his intended audience is not violent men who need help changing their ways, but all men, who, he says, have a role to play in preventing male violence against women. His basic assertion is that rape, battering, sexual abuse and harassment are so widespread that they must be viewed as a social problem rooted in our culture, not as the problem of troubled individuals. He urges men to directly confront the misogynistic attitudes and behavior of their peers. Some men may find Katz's advice occasionally baffling: he is full of directions about what not to do (such as paternalistic actions that deprive women of their autonomy). He wants to bring men into the larger discussion of pornography (which, he points out, has been dominated by women) and get them to look at its impact on themselves. Katz also presents eye-opening exercises and discussions from the MVP model that engender productive discussion among participants&#x2014;usually high school or college students. If only men would read Katz's book, it could serve as a potent form of male consciousness-raising. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Is it possible that history "overly remembers" some events at the expense of others? A landmark work in philosophy, Paul Ricoeur's <i>Memory, History, Forgetting</i> examines this reciprocal relationship between remembering and forgetting, showing how it affects both the perception of historical experience and the production of historical narrative.<br> <br> <i>Memory, History, Forgetting</i>, like its title, is divided into three major sections. Ricoeur first takes a phenomenological approach to memory and mnemonical devices. The underlying question here is how a memory of present can be of something absent, the past. The second section addresses recent work by historians by reopening the question of the nature and truth of historical knowledge. Ricoeur explores whether historians, who can write a history of memory, can truly break with all dependence on memory, including memories that resist representation. The third and final section is a profound meditation on the necessity of forgetting as a condition for the possibility of remembering, and whether there can be something like happy forgetting in parallel to happy memory. Throughout the book there are careful and close readings of the texts of Aristotle and Plato, of Descartes and Kant, and of Halbwachs and Pierre Nora.<br> <br> A momentous achievement in the career of one of the most significant philosophers of our age, <i>Memory, History, Forgetting</i> provides the crucial link between Ricoeur's <i>Time and Narrative</i> and <i>Oneself as Another</i> and his recent reflections on ethics and the problems of responsibility and representation.<br> <br> </p><p>&#x201c;His success in revealing the internal relations between recalling and forgetting, and how this dynamic becomes problematic in light of events once present but now past, will inspire academic dialogue and response but also holds great appeal to educated general readers in search of both method for and insight from considering the ethical ramifications of modern events. . . .

It was in the middle schools that much of the fury of the Cultural Revolution and Red Guard movement was spent, and Gao was caught up in very dramatic events, which he recounts as he understood them at the time. Gao&#39;s father was a county political official who was in and out of trouble during those years, and the intense interplay between father and son and the differing perceptions and impact of the Cultural Revolution for the two generations provide both an unusual perspective and some extraordinary moving moments. He also makes deft use of traditional mythology and proverbial wisdom to link, sometimes ironically, past and present. Gao relates in vivid fashion how students-turned-Red Guards held mass rallies against &#39;capitalist roader&#39; teachers and administrators, marching them through the streets to the accompaniment of chants and jeers and driving some of them to suicide. Eventually the students divided into two factions, and school and town became armed camps. Gao tells of the exhilaration that he and his comrades experienced at their initial victories, of their deepening disillusionment as they utter defeat as the tumultuous first phase of the Cultural Revolution came to a close. The portraits of the persons to whom Gao introduces us - classmates, teachers, family members - gain weight and density as the story unfolds, so that in the end we see how they all became victims of the dynamics of a mass movement out of control.</p><p>&#x201c;In Born Red, Gao Youan, a former Red Guard . . . tells us what it was like to be one of Mao&#x2019;s children in a provincial town four hours by train south of Peking.

When the boy's eyes were healed they removed the bandages and, waving a hand in front of the child's physically perfect eyes, asked him what he saw. "I don't know," was his only reply. What he saw was only a varying brightness in front of him. However, when allowed to touch the hand as it began to move, he cried out in a voice of triumph, "It's moving!" He could feel it move, but he still needed laboriously to learn to <em>see</em> it move. Light and eyes were not enough to grant him sight. How, then, do we see? What's the difference between seeing and perception? What is light?<br> From ancient times to the present, from philosophers to quantum physicists, nothing has so perplexed, so fascinated, so captivated the mind as the elusive definition of light. In <em>Catching the Light</em>, Arthur Zajonc takes us on an epic journey into history, tracing how humans have endeavored to understand the phenomenon of light. Blending mythology, religion, science, literature, and painting, Zajonc reveals in poetic detail the human struggle to identify the vital connection between the outer light of nature and the inner light of the human spirit. He explains the curiousness of the Greeks' blue and green "color blindness": Odysseus gazing longingly at the "wine-dark sea"; the use of chloros (green) as the color of honey in Homer's <em>Odessey</em>; and Euripides' use of the color green to describe the hue of tears and blood. He demonstrates the complexity of perception through the work of Paul C�zanne--the artist standing on the bank of a river, painting the same scene over and over again, the motifs multiplying before his eyes. And Zajonc goes on to show how our quest for an understanding of light, as well as the conclusions we draw, reveals as much about the nature of our own psyche as it does about the nature of light itself. For the ancient Egyptians the nature of light was clear--it simply was the gaze of God. In the hands of the ancient Greeks, light had become the luminous inner fire whose ethereal effluence brought sight. In our contemporary world of modern quantum physics, science plays the greatest part in our theories of light's origin--from scientific perspectives such as Sir Isaac Newton's "corpuscular theory of light" and Michael Faraday's "lines of force" to such revolutionary ideas as Max Planck's "discrete motion of a pendulum" (the basis of quantum mechanics), Albert Einstein's "particles of light" and "theory of relativity," and Niels Bohr's "quantum jumps." Yet the metaphysical aspects of the scientific search, Zajonc shows, still loom large. For the physicist Richard Feynman, a quantum particle travels all paths, eventually distilling to one path whose action is least--the most beautiful path of all. Whatever light is, here is where we will find it.<br> With rare clarity and unmatched lyricism, Zajonc illuminates the profound implications of the relationships between the multifaceted strands of human experience and scientific endeavor. A fascinating search into our deepest scientific mystery, <em>Catching the Light</em> is a brilliant synthesis that will both entertain and inform.<br></p><p>With rare clarity and unmatched lyricism, Zajonc illuminates the profound implications of the relationships between the multifaceted strands of human experience and scientific endeavor.

These down-to-earth practitioners absolutely rely on study, personal judgment, and their intuition. It has often been said that a Witch never stops studying and learning. This statement is very true and at the heart of the natWitch's craft. I find it interesting that if you look up the meaning of the word &#x201c;craft&#x201d; in <i>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, </i>you'll discover a most illuminating definition: Craft (n.) 1. Strength, skill. 2. Skill in planning, making, or executing. 3. An occupation or trade requiring manual dexterity or artistic skill. <br> <br>Witchcraft is a craft. It requires hands-on practice as you study and learn to become proficient at it. And just like any other type of craft, it can take years to find your own style and to develop your own personal techniques. And if you remember nothing else, remember that. This is about exploring your magickal preferences and celebrating your magickal style. <br> <br>I honestly don't care how Hannah the High Priestess does it three states over; I care about you and what <i>your </i>interests and talents are. For this is how you become an adept practitioner. You get in there, rely on your instincts, roll up your sleeves, study, experiand do the work. Welcome to a journey of self-discovery. <br> <br>So what makes you <i>you? </i>Defining who we are is more than the size of clothing you wear or the color of your eyes and hair. Our individuality comes from a light that is inof us: that divine spark we all carry. It's our insights, spirits, and personality. Trying to categorize Witches and magickal practitioners is a tough job. Sure, we all have our faways to describe ourselves, but let's step outside of the box, shall we? Celebrating our diversity in the Craft is an amazingly wonderful thing. <br> <br>We are <i>not </i>all the same--thank Goddess! We each have our own ideas and ways of practicing our craft. This should be celebrated, because that's what makes us powerful, our personality and our individuality. And don't you ever forget it. <br> <br>If you'd like to celebrate your right to be a magickal individual who listens to their intuition and follows their heart in the Craft, you have come to the right place. If these qualities remind you of yourself, then a natural approach to witchery is a good place for you to hang your Witch's hat. In the past, I have explored magick in the garden, in the home, and on each and every day of the week. This time, I want to go a little deeper and discuss our spirituality and individuality and to focus on our intuitions. <br> <br>Learning how to trust your intuition, instincts, and psychic impressions is a phenomway to boost the power of your natural magick. And before you start to argue, <i>every</i>has intuition and psychic abilities! It's simply up to the individual to look inside and to realize their own potential. Just as the Charge of the Goddess states, if you can't find what you're looking for within yourself, you'll never find it without. <br> <br>Now is when you must search deep inside your psyche and learn to be comfortable with yourself. I promise if you have the courage to do that, then you can develop new skills and a sensitivity to the magick around you. You will comprehend how to influyour environment and how to live your magickal life to the fullest. Together, we will discover how taking the journey within makes us stronger, unique, and more adept practitioners of the Craft. <br><i>The more we know, the better our intuition. <br></i>Christina Stead<br>Intuition: <br> <br>What It Is and Why It Is Important <br> <br>Magick is not only about working in harmony with the four elements and the natural world, it also involves listening to your intuition. Intuition itself comes from the primipart of our brains--the primal force called the survival instinct. This force comvital information from a different level of the consciousness, sometimes <br>dramatically, sometimes mundanely. Intuition doesn't arrive with swirls of pixie dust and an enchanting chime of harp strings; it's simply always there. <br> <br>Intuition may be defined as a quick and ready insight and immediate apprehension or cognition--the good old-fashioned &#x201c;gut hunch.&#x201d; You just <i>know</i>. For example, parents are very intuitive. They usually instinctively know when one of their kids is up to someor if one of them is ill. How about that feeling in the pit of your stomach that makes you turn around just in time to yank your toddler away from the hot stove? Or the hunch that makes you change lanes while driving because another driver is making you nervous, just in time to see that driver cut someone else off? When you realize with a start that if you hadn't paid attention and followed that hunch, you could have been in an accident. <i>That's</i> your intuition. <br> <br>Discovering your psychic abilities and working with your intuition is more simple than you think. It's easier to trust your instincts when you feel a Witch's connection to the natural world and the divine. This psychic ability is part of your genetic makeup, and it is a tool and an ally. Once you learn how to honor and tap into your intuition, your magick and your life improve for the better. <br> <br>One theory I found is that <i>magickal experiences are intuitive experiences felt at the spirilevel. </i>When I uncovered this, I was thrilled. Intuition isn't just a psychic thing; it is so much more. This natural ability corresponds with the magickal trinity of the earth, sea, and sky. No fooling! Intuition is associated with three main levels of awareness: the physical level, your bodily sensations, which ties to the earth; the emotional level, your feelings, which corresponds to the element of water and the sea; and finally the mental level, images and ideas, which links the element of air and the sky. <br> <br>Paying attention to and then acting on your intuition is a leap of faith. It is a daring thing to do. Everyone has some type of psychic ability, and intuition is one of the easiest psychic abilities to coax out. And I'm about to show you just how to go about it. In this chapter, we will take a look at the different types of psychic abilities and see how to idenand access them. Let's get better acquainted with intuition so we can incorporate this very personal and individual psychic power into your life and your magick. <br> <br><i>The psychic mind is both the key and doorway to our magickal talents. <br></i>Christopher Penczak <br> <br>Psychic Abilities and the Craft <br>As magickal practitioners, it is well worth taking the time to explore our psychic abiliAcquiring an understanding of what our individual gifts are and how they work will enable us to connect with the wisdom deep within our own souls. This makes persense to me, as the word <i>psychic</i> originally comes from the Greek word <i>psyche</i>, mean&#x201c;soul.&#x201d; This chapter will help you identify and discover your own strengths, as well as present ideas for adding this soul-power to your magick. <br> <br>Without a doubt, we all have psychic abilities of some sort. If you look up the term <i>psychic </i>today, it is typically used to describe a person who is sensitive to nonphysical or supernatural forces. Now, personally, I don't buy into the term <i>supernatural</i>. Intuition and psychic abilities are perfectly natural; there is nothing otherworldly about them. I think a better term is &#x201c;unseen.&#x201d; These unseen forces are all around you, all the time. To sense them, you need only to open up your awareness and take your sensitivity to a whole new level. So, how do you start? By acknowledging your intuition. This act can open up a person to many new levels of consciousness. <br> <br>You do have the right to follow and express your intuition. Intuition is sometimes called the sixth sense. The sixth sense is beyond the traditional five of hearing, sight, smell, taste, and touch. The sixth sense is an internal awareness and a sense of percepthat is outside of the expected, everyday flow of physical impressions and thoughts. These intuitive messages can be subtle--you may not even realize they are there until you train yourself to pay attention. At other times, they may grab hold of you and not shake loose until you focus on what they are trying to tell you. <br> <br>Some folks will experience intuition as a quick spark of inspiration or sense it as a strong &#x201c;gut hunch.&#x201d; You know, that feeling you get down in your belly that tightens painuntil you pay attention? That's a gut hunch. Other people think of it as an inner voice that whispers to them, and some folks experience psychic abilities in full-color images and visions. It's also common to get a combination effect of several of the above. No matter how it manifests, intuition is a powerful guide and ally. <br> <br>Well then, how do you get the psychic abilities to &#x201c;turn on&#x201d;? You start by testing <br>yourand then you practice and begin working out those psychic muscles. There are a few tips and tricks I have learned over the years, and these psychic exercises can help you trigger your extrasensory abilities. Everyone can benefit from these exercises, and bethat, they are a lot of fun to do. The reason for flexing these new mystical muscles is simple: the more you develop your psychic abilities, the clearer your own magickal path can become. <br> <br>P s y c h i c &nbsp;E x e r c i s e s <br> <br>Light Up Those Chakras <br> <br>The seven chakras are zones of energy. Picture them as glowing orbs of energy arin a line straight down the center of the body. The chakras are all the colors of the rainbow: <br>One of the basic steps to turning on your psychic abilities is to light up the chakras. By this, I mean you envision them as pulsing with bright, glowing colors. <br>Studying the energy centers of the body could fill up an entire book on its own, but we are going to keep this simple here. This is a visualization exercise that only takes about five minutes. It calls for you to picture the chakras as glowing orbs of energy, and then turn up their light, so you visualize them glowing brightly and pulsing with energy. <br> <br>Begin by getting out paper and a pen so you can quickly write down your impreswhen you are finished with the exercise. Set them in a handy spot nearby. You can start this exercise by sitting easily on the floor and resting your hands comfortably in your lap. Roll your head around gently, and stretch out your neck and shoulders. Close your eyes. (This act will force you to focus on your psychic impressions, not your physiones.) Take a few deep, cleansing breaths, and ground and center yourself. <br> <br>Now picture the root chakra that sits at the base of your spine. This orb of light is bright red. This chakra is known as the seat of power, and it is a place of raw energy and a grounding force. This chakra connects you to the physical world. Picture this ball of light as glowing with a vivid red and warm light. <br> <br>Next move up to the belly chakra. This chakra center is between the base of the spine and your navel, in the abdomen area. This sphere of light is orange. This chakra is thought to influence your instincts, emotions, and personal power. This is the area where &#x201c;gut hunches&#x201d; begin. Light it up and see the orb as glowing a beautiful, bright orIf you feel your belly clenching as you turn on this power area, take a deep breath, and try to relax those muscles. After a moment, go ahead and move on. <br> <br>Now we go to the solar plexus. This is directly beneath the rib cage and above the navel. This orb is a brilliant yellow color, and as you focus on this area you may notice it tightening up as well. What do you sense when you focus on this psychic center? This is considered the &#x201c;soul area,&#x201d; and your psychic intuition and personal power are linked to this region of the body, as is your magickal will. This is the energy center where psyimpressions physically gather. At this point of the body, you can literally feel the intuitive impressions tighten up your muscles. Give yourself a moment to experience the sensation, and gather any impressions as you light up this area. <br> <br>Next, turn your focus to the heart chakra. It will be a gorgeous grass-green color, found right where you'd expect it--the middle of the chest. From this energy center, your emotions and love radiate out. Unconditional love and strong emotions come from this chakra. Light up this sphere and feel the sensation of perfect love and perfect trust spread out through your whole body. Enjoy this lovely sensation for a bit, and then move on to the next chakra. <br> <br>The throat chakra is located at the hollow of the throat. This chakra is a stunning sapblue. Turn it on, and visualize it as glowing bright along with the other chakras. This chakra controls how we communicate with others and how well we listen. Psychic hearing is governed from this area. As you visualize this chakra expanding and lighting up, listen carefully and see what your inner voice has to say. <br> <br>Next, shift your focus up to the middle of your forehead, the third eye area. This chakra is a gorgeous amethyst-violet color. This energy center is the point of your psyvision and perception. Illuminate this orb of light. Take a moment to experience the difference in your awareness as you focus on the center of energy that clairvoyance (called psychic sight) comes from. Give yourself a short time, and &#x201c;see&#x201d; what you can perceive. <br> <br>Lastly, shift your attention to the top of your head, called the crown. The crown chakra is a brilliant white, and this where we experience and sense the divine in our lives. Here is where you link to the God and Goddess, in everyday life and during magick. From this chakra, we experience divine love. Let this orb billow out in a dazzling white halo, and take a moment to experience the love of all of creation. <br> <br>Now that all seven chakras are lit up and pulsing with positive energy, take a few moand enjoy the experience. What sort of psychic impressions are you gathering? Does one part of your body feel more &#x201c;turned up&#x201d; than the others? Focus on it, and ask yourself what you need to know. Don't think this to death; just see what you feel. <br> <br>After a little while, turn down the brightness of the chakras. I like to picture a dimswitch that I turn so the light gets softer. If it will help, pantomime the action of turning the switch down in a counterclockwise turn. If you notice one of the chakras is still bigger than the others or you have a tightening in one part of your body, take a deep breath, and make those muscles relax. If it helps, rub your hands over the area to help the muscles loosen up. <br> <br>Then reach down to the floor directly in front of the base chakra and &#x201c;zip&#x201d; all the seven chakras closed. Raise your hand up in front of your body, in a straight line, and finish up as high as you can reach. No muss, no fuss. If you don't fling your arm around, it appears to the casual observer that you are merely stretching. <br> <br>Ground and center, placing the palms of your hands flat on the ground. Hold that pose for a moment so that you may send any excess energy safely back into the earth and so you can pull up stabilizing energy from the earth as well, should you need it. Allow yourself to relax. Once you've done that, open your eyes, place your hands in a natural pose, and relax your posture. Take some time to jot down your impressions. Now that you've worked your way through this chakra exercise once, it only gets easier and quicker every time. <br> <br>Receive Psychic Impressions as...</p><h2>Through Fire and Water: An Overview of Mennonite History</h2><p>Through Fire and Water presents the Mennonite faith story within the sweep of church history.

Set in the 1880s at the dawn of the age of electricity and based on the bizarre historical fact that doctors used vibrators to treat &#39;hysterical&#39; women (and some men), the play centers on a doctor and his wife and how his new therapy affects their entire household. In a seemingly perfect, well-to-do Victorian home, proper gentleman and scientist Dr. Givings has innocently invented an extraordinary new device for treating &#34;hysteria&#34; in women (and occasionally men): the vibrator. Adjacent to the doctor&#39;s laboratory, his young and energetic wife tries to tend to their newborn daughter-and wonders exactly what is going on in the next room. When a new &#34;hysterical&#34; patient and her husband bring a wet nurse and their own complicated relationship into the doctor&#39;s home, Dr. and Mrs. Givings must examine the nature of their own marriage, and what it truly means to love someone. This laugh out loud, provocative and touching play premiered at Berkely Rep and subsequently marked Sarah Ruhl&#39;s Broadway debut opening at the Lyceum Theatre on November 19th, 2009.

But what really gives the work its distinction is its sensitive exploration of the physical and emotional repression suffered by the women of the era, which has yet to disappear entirely....The play beautifully balances its humor and pathos.&#34; -Hollywood Reporter</p><p></p><h2>The Witch&#39;s Vacuum Cleaner and Other Stories</h2><p><p><em>Do you believe in magic?

A follow-up to <em>Dragons at Crumbling Castle</em>, this second batch of storytelling gems features stories written when Sir Terry was just seventeen years old and working as a junior reporter. In these pages, new Pratchett fans will find wonder, mayhem, sorcery, and delight&#x2014;and loyal readers will recognize the seeds of ideas that went on to influence his most beloved tales later in life.</p><p>As Neil Gaiman says, &#x201c;a Terry Pratchett book is a small miracle&#x201d;&#x2014;and <em>The Witch&#x2019;s Vacuum Cleaner </em>proves to be another miracle taking its place alongside Pratchett&#x2019;s astounding and cherished body of work.</p></p><p><p><strong>Sir Terry Pratchett</strong> was the internationally bestselling author of more than thirty books, including his phenomenally successful Discworld series. His young adult novel, <em>The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents</em>, won the Carnegie Medal, and <em>Where's My Cow?</em>, his Discworld book for &#x201c;readers of all ages,&#x201d; was a <em>New York Times </em>bestseller. His novels have sold more than seventy&nbsp;five&nbsp;million (give or take a few million) copies worldwide.

Each story is well-developed, engaging, and complex. Laced with the humor only Pratchett can deliver, this volume of tales is a great way to remember the late author's writing style. Some of the characters' names, when read aloud, are even good for a laugh. Quirky footnotes, text that pops off the page, and memorable scenes draw readers deep into Pratchett's world. VERDICT This is a must-read for any fantasy, adventure, or Pratchett fan&#x2014;and a great way to introduce his writings to a new generation.&#x2014;Kira Moody, Whitmore Public Library, Salt Lake City</p><h2>Divine Signatures: The Confirming Hand of God</h2><p>Heavenly Father, are you really there? As Latter- day Saints, we know God exists, but at some point we may wonder, Heavenly Father, are you really there for me? When trials seem beyond our ability to bear, some people lose their spiritual bearings, while others are made even stronger. How can we strengthen our faith and deepen our testimony to the point that we can endure whatever life holds in store for us and come out stronger than before? In this unique book, Gerald N. Lund Reminds us of how much God loves His children and that He is anxious to bless them, especially when they are striving to do His will. Teaches that God often sends blessings in such a highly unusual, dramatic, or precisely timed manner that its as if the Lord signs the blessing personally so we know with certainty that it came from Him. Relates stories from Church history, from his own life, and from acquaintances that illustrate the inspiring and life- changing insights he shares.</p><p>Gerald N. Lund served as a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy from 2002 to 2008. He holds degrees from BYU and also did graduate work at Pepperdine University and the University of Judaism in California. He worked for the Church Educational System for thirty- five years as a teacher, writer, and zone administrator. A prolific writer of both doctrinal works and fiction, he is best known for his series of historical novels The Work and the Glory. He and his wife, Lynn, are the parents of seven children and live in Alpine, Utah.</p><h2>Healing Life&#39;s Hurts: Healing Memories through the Five Stages of Forgiveness</h2><p>Explores the concept of emotional and physical healing as well as exploring the five stages of acceptance of death and dying in light of prayer and religious experience.</p><p>Dennis, Sheila, and Matt Linn have given retreats and seminars on processes for healing in over fifty countries and in many universities and hospitals, including a course to doctors accredited by the American Medical Association.

Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy and published a poetry collection in 1924 at his own expense. In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. He died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962.One<br><br>1<br><br>As usual old man Falls had brought John Sartoris into the room with him, had walked the three miles in from the county Poor Farm, fetching, like an odor, like the clean dusty smell of his faded overalls, the spirit of the dead man into that room where the dead man's son sat and where the two of them, pauper and banker, would sit for a half an hour in the company of him who had passed beyond death and then returned.<br><br>Freed as he was of time and flesh, he was a far more palpable presence than either of the two old men who sat shouting periodically into one another's deafness while the business of the bank went forward in the next room and people in the adjoining stores on either side listened to the indistinguishable uproar of their voices coming through the walls. He was far more palpable than the two old men cemented by a common deafness to a dead period and so drawn thin by the slow attenuation of days; even now, although old man Falls had departed to tramp the three miles back to that which he now called home, John Sartoris seemed to loom still in the room, above and about his son, with his bearded, hawklike face, so that as old Bayard sat with his crossed feet propped against the corner of the cold hearth, holding the pipe in his hand, it seemed to him that he could hear his father's breathing even, as though that other were so much more palpable than mere transiently articulated clay as to even penetrate into the uttermost citadel of silence in which his son lived.<br><br>The bowl of the pipe was ornately carved and it was charred with much usage, and on the bit were the prints of his father's teeth, where he had left the very print of his ineradicable bones as though in enduring stone, like the creatures of that prehistoric day that were too grandly conceived and executed either to exist very long or to vanish utterly when dead from an earth shaped and furnished for punier things. Old Bayard sat holding the pipe in his hand.<br><br>"What are you giving it to me for, after all this time?" he had asked, fingering the pipe, and old man Falls answered.<br><br>"Well, I reckon I've kept it long as Cunnel aimed for me to," old man Falls answered. "A po' house aint no fitten place for anything of his'n, Bayard. And I'm goin' on ninety-fo' year old."<br><br>Later he gathered up his small parcels and left, but still old Bayard sat for some time, the pipe in his hand, rubbing the bowl slowly with his thumb. After a while John Sartoris departed also, withdrawn rather to that place where the peaceful dead contemplate their glamorous frustrations, and old Bayard rose and thrust the pipe into his pocket and took a cigar from the humidor on the mantel. As he struck the match the door across the room opened and a man wearing a green eyeshade entered and approached.<br><br>"Simon's here, Colonel," he said in a voice utterly without inflection.<br><br>"What?" Old Bayard said across the match.<br><br>"Simon's come."<br><br>"Oh. All right."<br><br>The other turned and went out. Old Bayard flung the match into the grate and put the cigar in his pocket and closed his desk and took his black felt hat from the top of it and followed the other from the room. The man in the eyeshade and the cashier were busy beyond the grille. Old Bayard stalked on through the lobby and passed through the door with its drawn green shade and emerged upon the street, where Simon in a linen duster and an ancient top-hat held the matched geldings glittering in the spring afternoon, at the curb.<br><br>There was a hitching-post there, which old Bayard retained with a testy disregard of industrial progress, but Simon never used it. Until the door opened and Bayard emerged from behind the drawn shades bearing the words "Bank Closed" in cracked gold leaf, Simon retained his seat, the reins in his left hand and the thong of the whip caught smartly back in his right and usually the unvarying and seemingly incombustible fragment of a cigar at a swaggering angle in his black face, talking to the shining team in a steady, lover-like flow. He spoiled horses. He admired Sartorises and he had for them a warmly protective tenderness, but he loved horses, and beneath his hands the sorriest beast bloomed and acquired comeliness like a caressed woman, temperament like an opera star.<br><br>Old Bayard closed the door behind him and crossed to the carriage with that stiff erectness which, as a countryman once remarked, if he ever stumbled, would meet itself falling down. One or two passers and a merchant or so in the adjacent doorways saluted him with a sort of florid servility, and behind him the shade on one window drew aside upon the disembodied face of the man in the green eye-shade. The book- keeper was a hillman of indeterminate age, a silent man who performed his duties with tedious slow care and who watched Bayard constantly and covertly all the while he was in view.<br><br>Nor did Simon dismount even then. With his race's fine feeling for potential theatrics he drew himself up and arranged the limp folds of the duster, communicating by some means the histrionic moment to the horses so that they too flicked their glittering coats and tossed their leashed heads, and into Simon's wizened black face there came an expression indescribably majestical as he touched his whiphand to his hatbrim. Bayard got into the carriage and Simon clucked to the horses, and the onlookers, halted to admire the momentary drama of the departure, fell behind.<br><br>There was something different in Simon's air today, in the very shape of his back and the angle of his hat: he appeared to be bursting with something momentous and ill-contained. But he withheld it for the time being, and at a dashing, restrained pace he drove among the tethered wagons about the square and swung into a broad street where what Bayard called paupers sped back and forth in automobiles, and withheld it until the town was behind them and they trotted on across burgeoning countryside cluttered still with gasoline-propelled paupers but at greater intervals, and his employer had settled back for the changing and peaceful monotony of the four-mile drive. Then Simon checked the team to a more sedate pace and turned his head.<br><br>His voice was not particularly robust nor resonant, yet somehow he could talk to old Bayard without difficulty. Others must shout in order to penetrate that wall of deafness beyond which Bayard lived; yet Simon could and did hold long, rambling conversations with him in that monotonous, rather high sing-song of his, particularly while in the carriage, the vibration of which helped Bayard's hearing a little.<br><br>"Mist' Bayard done got home," Simon remarked in a conversational tone.<br><br>Old Bayard sat perfectly and furiously still for a moment while his heart went on, a little too fast and a little too lightly, cursing his grandson for a furious moment; sat so still that Simon looked back and found him gazing quietly out across the land. Simon raised his voice a little.<br><br>"He got offen de two oclock train," he continued. "Jumped off de wrong side and lit out th'ough de woods. Section hand seed 'im. Only he aint never come out home yit when I lef'. I thought he wuz wid you, maybe." Dust spun from beneath the horses' feet and moiled in a sluggish cloud behind them. Against the thickening hedgerows their shadow rushed in failing surges, with twinkling spokes and high-stepping legs in a futility of motion without progress. "Wouldn't even git off at de dee- po," Simon continued, with a kind of fretful exasperation. "De dee-po his own folks built. Jumpin' offen de bline side like a hobo. He never even had on no sojer-clothes. Jes a suit, lak a drummer er somethin'. And when I 'members dem shiny boots and dem light yaller pants and dat 'ere double-jinted backin'-up strop he wo' home las' year. . . ." He turned and looked back again. "Cunnel, you reckon dem war folks is done somethin' ter him?"<br><br>"What do you mean?" Bayard demanded. "Is he lame?"<br><br>"I mean, him sneakin' into his own town. Sneakin' into town, on de ve'y railroad his own gran'pappy built, jes' like he wuz trash. Dem foreign folks done done somethin' ter him, er dey done sot dey po-lice atter him. I kep' a-tellin' him when he fust went off to dat 'ere foreign war him and Mr Johnny neither never had no business at--"<br><br>"Drive on," Bayard said. . . . . . . "Drive on, damn your black hide."<br><br>Simon clucked to the horses and shook them into a swifter gait. The road went on between hedgerows parallelling them with the senseless terrific antics of their shadow. Beyond the bordering gums and locusts and massed vines, fields new-broken or being broken spread on toward patches of woodland newly green and splashed with dogwood and judas trees. Behind laborious plows viscid shards of new-turned earth glinted damply in the sun.<br><br>This was upland country, lying in tilted slopes against the unbroken blue of the hills, but soon the road descended sheerly into a valley of good broad fields richly somnolent in the levelling afternoon, and presently they drove upon Bayard's own land, and from time to time a plowman lifted his hand to the passing carriage. Then the road approached the railroad and crossed it, and at last the house John Sartoris had built and rebuilt stood among locusts and oaks and Simon swung between iron gates and into a curving drive.<br><br>There was a bed of salvia where a Yankee patrol had halted on a day long ago. Simon brought up here with a flourish and Bayard descended and Simon clucked to the team again and rolled his cigar to a freer angle, and took the road back to town.<br><br>Bayard stood for a while before his house, but the white simplicity of it dreamed unbroken among ancient sunshot trees. Wistaria mounting one end of the veranda had bloomed and fallen, and a faint drift of shattered petals lay palely about the dark roots of it and about the roots of a rose trained onto the same frame. The rose was slowly but steadily choking the other vine, and it bloomed now thickly with buds no bigger than a thumbnail and blown flowers no larger than silver dollars, myriad, odorless and unpickable.<br><br>But the house itself was still and serenely benignant, and he mounted to the empty, colonnaded veranda and crossed it and entered the hall. The house was silent, richly desolate of motion or any sound.<br><br>"Bayard."<br><br>The stairway with its white spindles and red carpet mounted in a tall slender curve into upper gloom. From the center of the ceiling hung a chandelier of crystal prisms and shades, fitted originally for candles but since wired for electricity; to the right of the entrance, beside folding doors rolled back upon a dim room emanating an atmosphere of solemn and seldom violated stateliness and known as the parlor, stood a tall mirror filled with grave obscurity like a still pool of evening water. At the opposite end of the hall checkered sunlight fell in a long slant across the door, and from somewhere beyond the bar of sunlight a voice rose and fell in a steady preoccupied minor, like a chant. The words were not distinguishable, but Bayard could not hear them at all. He raised his voice again.<br><br>"Bayard."<br><br>The chanting ceased, and as he turned toward the stairs a tall mulatto woman appeared in the slanting sunlight without the back door and came sibilantly into the house. Her faded blue garment was pinned up about her knees and it was darkly and irregularly blotched. Beneath it her shanks were straight and lean as the legs of a tall bird, and her bare feet were pale coffee-splashes on the dark polished floor.<br><br>"Wuz you callin' somebody, Cunnel?" she said, raising her voice to penetrate his deafness. Bayard paused with his hand on the walnut newel post and looked down at the woman's pleasant yellow face.<br><br>"Has anybody come in this afternoon?" he asked.<br><br>"Why, naw, suh," Elnora answered. "Dey aint nobody here a-tall, dat I knows about. Miss Jenny done gone to huh club-meetin' in town dis evenin'," she added. Bayard stood with his foot raised to the step, glowering at her.<br><br>"Why in hell cant you niggers tell me the truth about things?" he raged suddenly. "Or not tell me anything at all?"<br><br>"Lawd, Cunnel, who'd be comin' out here, lessen you er Miss Jenny sont 'um?" But he had gone on, tramping furiously up the stairs. The woman looked after him, then she raised her voice: "Does you want Isom, er anything?" He did not look back. Perhaps he had not heard her, and she stood and watched him out of sight. "He's gittin' old," she said to herself quietly, and she turned on her sibilant bare feet and returned down the hall whence she had come.<br><br>Bayard stopped again in the upper hall. The western windows were closed with latticed blinds, through which sunlight seeped in yellow dissolving bars that but served to increase the gloom. At the opposite end a tall door opened upon a shallow grilled balcony which offered the valley and the cradling semicircle of the eastern hills in panorama. On either side of this door was a narrow window set with leaded panes of vari-colored glass that, with the bearer of them, constituted John Sartoris' mother's deathbed legacy to him, which his youngest sister had brought from Carolina in a straw-filled hamper in '69.</p><h2>Back to School with Betsy (Odyssey/Harcourt Young Classic)</h2><p>Carolyn Haywood's stories about her irrepressible character Betsy have never been out of print, and now, thanks to dynamic new covers, the Betsy books will find their way onto the bookshelves of modern young readers--and into the hearts of a whole new generation.<br> <br>Third grade begins with disappointment--Betsy's beloved teacher, Miss Grey, won't be teachng anymore.

The excitement of being able to train based on that advice is further enhanced by the stimulation and support that guidance manuals provide. All of the selections presented in Perfect Clarity offer incredible teachings that are inspiring and vital. Pith instructions are so simple and direct that we can easily apply them without fear of mistakes.<br>These days, the most effective style of teaching is not lengthy scholarly explanations but rather direct guidance manuals The Dzogchen tantras themselves were written in a style that shrouds and conceals the meaning so that only a master who is extremely well-versed in oral instructions and treatises is able to clarify the meaning. On the other hand, based upon oral instructions a guidance manual is a short, comprehensive teaching written in a clear and simple manner. Such summaries of the Mahamudra and Dzogchen teachings contain all the teachings that a worthy practitioner requires to reach the state of primordial enlightenment in this very life.<br>Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche<br><br>The amazing collection in Perfect Clarity is rounded out by an introduction by Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, a preface by Marcia Dechen Wangmo, biographical data of the authors, a glossary, line drawings and photos and Tibetan source material references.<br><br></p><p>Erik Pema Kunsang, also known as Erik Hein Schmidt, is known as one of the world's most gifted interpreters of Tibetan into English&#x2014;although Danish was his first language.

Much of that knowledge is gathered in <i>The Green Pharmacy,</i> an A-to-Z guide to that relies on plant-based medicines to cure what ails us. Between the listings, Duke crams personal anecdotes from a lifetime of studying herbs, berries, and bark. For example, he relates how he worried about telling a pregnant niece that ginger could help alleviate her morning sickness because he'd learned from a pharmacologist that ginger could also induce miscarriage. Then he solved the mystery: he'd recommended ginger tea, which contains about 250 milligrams of ginger. The Chinese, he learned, use about 80 times that much to end pregnancies--another testimony to the amazing versatility of these natural medicines."<i>The Green Pharmacy</i> is full of helpful, practical information about using plants as medicines. I plan to consult it often." --Andrew Weil, M.D., Director of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona, and author of <i>Spontaneous Healing</i><p> "Filled with gems of wisdom--a treasure of information from a man who knows as much as anyone in the world about medicinal plants." --Jean Carper, author of <i>Miracle Cures</i></p></p><h2>Graphic Design: A Concise History, Second Edition (World of Art)</h2><p><p><strong>From its roots in the development of printing, graphic design has evolved as a means of identification, information, and promotion to become a profession and discipline in its own right.</strong></p> This authoritative documentary history begins with the poster and goes on to chart the development of word and image in brochures and magazines, advertising, corporate identity, television, and electronic media, and the impact of technical innovations such as photography and the computer. For the revised edition, a new final chapter covers all the recent international developments in graphic design, including the role of the computer and the Internet in design innovation and globalization. In the last years of the twentieth century, at a time when "designer products" and the use of logos grew in importance, the role of graphic designers became more complex, subversive, and sometimes more political&#x2015;witness Oliviero Toscani's notorious advertisements for Benetton. Digital technology cleared the way for an astonishing proliferation of new typefaces, and words began to take second place to typography in a whole range of magazines and books as designers asserted the primacy of their medium. Designers and companies discussed here include Neville Brody, David Carson, Design Writing Research, Edward Fella, Tibor Kalman, Jeffery Keedy, LettError, Pierre di Sciullo, Tomato, Gerard Unger, Cornel Windlin, and a host of others.

In this extraordinary memoir, she opens a window into the experience of wordlessness&#x2015;the language paralysis called aphasia. In narrating the recovery of her husband, Paul West, from a stroke that reduced his vast vocabulary to a single syllable, she evokes the joy and mystery of the brain&#x2019;s ability to find and connect words. Deeply rewarding to readers of all kinds, Ackerman has given us a literary love story, accessible insight into the science and medicine of brain injury, and invaluable spiritual sustenance in the face of life&#x2019;s myriad physical sufferings.</p><p>Diane Ackerman has been the finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction in addition to many other awards and recognitions for her work, which include the best-selling The Zookeeper&#39;s Wife and A Natural History of the Senses. She lives in Ithaca, New York.*Starred Review* Two wordsmiths enthralled by the glimmering pleasures of the life of the mind have lived together in literary camaraderie for decades. So when novelist, memoirist, and critic Paul West was hit with a stroke in 2005 that left his brain scorched and his body battered, both he and his wife, Diane Ackerman, a poet and the lushly original author of such seismic books as The Zookeeper&#x2019;s Wife (2007), had a lot to lose. But West never succumbed to his impaired vision, frozen right hand, or, most remarkably, bewildering and silencing global aphasia; and Ackerman, who by fortuitous prescience had conducted extensive neurological research for her book An Alchemy of Mind (2004), proved to be an ideal caregiver. Writing with her signature empathy, curiosity, brilliance, and mirth, Ackerman chronicles West&#x2019;s heroic battle to reclaim words and mobility and her tailoring of West&#x2019;s speech therapy to match his spectacular vocabulary and unique intelligence. A master of vivid metaphors and multifaceted narratives, Ackerman candidly addresses the profound demands facing caregivers while explaining the cruel consequences of aphasia, charting West&#x2019;s against-all-odds return to conversing and writing (The Shadow Factory, 2008) and marveling over the healing powers of language and intimacy. A gorgeously engrossing, affecting, sweetly funny, and mind-opening love story of crisis, determination, creativity, and repair. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Cure Cancer with Urine Therapy: SHIVAMBU &#34;Nectar of Life&#34;</h2><p><p>Auto-Urine Therapy known as &#x201c;Shivambu&#x201d; is an ancient method of treatment, which has been continuing from generation to generation. In the ancient days, many sages and rishimunis followed and practiced urine therapy. Lord Shiva himself recommended the action and ritual of Shivambu Kalpa to Mother Parvati mentioned in ancient book Damar Tantra. The powerful practice for healing, Auto-Urine Therapy, has been referred to as &#x201c;Shivambu Kalpa Vidhi&#x201d; in 5000-year-old documents called Damar Tantra in the Vedas. God has given a wonderful gift to man, his own water &#x2013; Shivambu. Shiv means beneficial and salubrious, and Ambu means water. The combined Sanskrit word is Shivambu (beneficial water). They termed Shivambu as the holy liquid. This book is published to enlighten everyone who is diagnosed with cancer to adopt Urine Therapy before going for surgery or chemotherapy. It is safe and does not have any side effects. It can prevent and control/cure cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>It is free of cost and can be practiced at home.

I&#x2019;d long assumed that I had been genetically scripted to robust physical health, like my mother, who never even catches a head cold. All of my relatives on her side, the Loewens, enjoy preternaturally good health, unless you count breast cancer and polio. The polio is pretty much a done deal, thanks to Jonas Salk and his talent for globally useful vaccinations. Yet in the days before Jonas Salk, when my mother was a girl, polio crippled her younger brother Abe and also withered the arm of her closest sister Gertrude. Trude bravely went on to raise two kids one-armed, and to name her withered arm Stinky. </p><p>_____ Yes, I think &#x201c;Stinky&#x201d; is a cute name for a withered arm! </p><p>_____ No, I&#x2019;d prefer to name my withered arm something with a little more dignity, such as Reynaldo. </p><p>Although breast cancer also runs in my family, it hasn&#x2019;t played a significant role. It comes to us late in life, shriveling a tit or two, and then often subsiding under the composite resistance of chemo and buttermilk. That is, it would shrivel our tits if we had tits. Which we don&#x2019;t. </p><p>As adolescents, my sister Hannah and I were naturally anxious to see if we would turn out more like our mother or our father. There was a lot at stake. Having endured a painfully uncool childhood, we realized that our genetic heritage positioned us on a precarious cusp. Dad was handsome but grouchy; Mom was plain but cheerful. Would we be able to pass muster in normal society, or would our Mennonite history forever doom us to outsider status? </p><p>My father, once the head of the North American Mennonite Conference for Canada and the United States, is the Mennonite equivalent of the pope, but in plaid shorts and black dress socks pulled up snugly along the calf. In the complex moral universe that is Mennonite adulthood, a Mennonite can be good-looking and still have no sartorial taste whatsoever. My father may actually be unaware that he is good-looking. He is a theologian who believes in a loving God, a servant heart, and a senior discount. Would God be pleased if we spent an unnecessary thirty-one cents at McDonald&#x2019;s? I think not. </p><p>At six foot five and classically handsome, Dad has an imposing stature that codes charismatic elocution and a sobering, insightful air of authority. I&#x2019;ve considered the possibility that his wisdom and general seriousness make him seem handsomer than he actually is, but whatever the reason, Dad is one of those people to whom everybody listens. No matter who you are, you do not snooze through this man&#x2019;s sermons. Even if you are an atheist, you find yourself nodding and thinking, <em>Preach it, mister!</em> </p><p>Well, not nodding. Maybe you <em>imagine</em> you&#x2019;re nodding. But in this scenario you are in a Mennonite church, which means you sit very still and worship Jesus with all your heart, mind, and soul, only as if a snake had bitten you, and you are now in the last stages of paralysis. </p><p>I may be the first person to mention my father&#x2019;s good looks in print. Good looks are considered a superfluous feature in a Mennonite world leader, because Mennonites are all about service. Theoretically, we do not even know what we look like, since a focus on our personal appearance is vainglorious. Our antipathy to vainglory explains the decision of many of us to wear those frumpy skirts and the little doilies on our heads, a decision we must have arrived at only by collectively determining not to notice what we had put on that morning. </p><p>My mother, unlike my father, is not classically handsome. But she does enjoy good health. She is as buoyant as a lark on a summer&#x2019;s morn. Nothing gets this woman down. She is the kind of mother who, when we were growing up, came singing into our bedrooms at 6:00 a.m., tunefully urging us to rise and shine and give God the glory, glory. And this was on Saturday, Saturday. Upbeat she is. Glamorous she is not. Once she bought Hannah a black T-shirt that said in glittery magenta cursive, NASTY!! She didn&#x2019;t know what it meant. When we told her, she said sunnily, &#x201c;Oh well, then you can wear it to work in the garden!&#x201d; </p><p>Besides being born Mennonite, which is usually its own beauty strike, my mother has no neck. When we were growing up, our mother&#x2019;s head, sprouting directly from her shoulders like a friendly lettuce, became something of a family focus. We&#x2019;d take every opportunity to thrust hats and baseball caps upon her, which made us all shriek with unconscionable laughter. Mom would laugh good-naturedly, but if we got too out of hand, she&#x2019;d predict that our Loewen genes would eventually assert themselves. </p><p>And they did. Although I personally have and appreciate a neck, I was, by my early forties, the very picture of blooming Loewen health: peasant-cheeked, impervious to germs, hearty as an ox. I rarely got sick. And the year before the main action of this memoir occurs, I had sustained a physical debilitation&#x2014;I won&#x2019;t say <em>illness</em>&#x2014;so severe that I thought I was statistically safe for years to come. </p><p>I was only forty-two at the time, but my doctor advised a radical salpingo-oopherectomy. For the premenopausal set, that translates to &#x201c;Your uterus has got to go.&#x201d; A hushed seriousness hung in the air when the doctor first broached the subject of the hysterectomy. </p><p>I said, &#x201c;You mean dump my whole uterus? Ovaries and everything?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m afraid so.&#x201d; </p><p>I considered a moment. I knew I should be feeling a kind of feminist outrage, but it wasn&#x2019;t happening. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; </p><p>Dr. Mayler spoke some solemn words about a support group. From his tone I gathered that I also ought to be feeling a profound sense of loss, and a cosmic unfairness that this was happening to me at age forty-two, instead of at age&#x2014;what?&#x2014;fifty-six? I dutifully wrote down the contact information for the support group, thinking that maybe I was in denial again. Maybe the seriousness and the pathos of the salpingo-oopherectomy would register later. By age forty-two I had learned that denial was my special modus operandi. Big life lessons always kicked in tardily for me. I&#x2019;ve always been a bit of a late bloomer, a slow learner. The postman has to ring twice, if you get my drift. </p><p>My husband, who got a vasectomy two weeks after we married, was all for the hysterectomy. &#x201c;Do it,&#x201d; he urged. &#x201c;Why do you need that thing? You don&#x2019;t use it, do you?&#x201d; </p><p>In general, Nick&#x2019;s policy was, if you haven&#x2019;t used it in a year, throw it out. We lived in homes with spare, ultramodern decor. Once he convinced me to furnish a coach house with nothing but a midcentury dining table and three perfect floor cushions. You know the junk drawer next to the phone? Ours contained a single museum pen and a pad of artisan paper on a Herman Miller tray. </p><p>Nick therefore supported the hysterectomy, but only on the grounds of elegant understatement. To him the removal of unnecessary anatomical parts was like donating superfluous crap to Goodwill. Had the previous owners left a beer raft in the garage, as a thoughtful gift to you? No thanks! We weren&#x2019;t the type of people who would store a beer raft in our garage&#x2014;not because we opposed beer rafts per se, but because we did not want to clutter an uncompromising vista of empty space. Nick led the charge to edit our belongings, but I willingly followed. Had you secretly been wearing the same bra since 1989? Begone, old friend! Were you clinging to a sentimental old wedding dress? Heave ho! Nick&#x2019;s enthusiasm for the hysterectomy made me a little nervous. I kept taking my internal temperature, checking for melancholy.

But, as Cynthia Moe-Lobeda argues, the future of the earth is not simply a matter of protecting species and habitats but of rethinking the very meaning of Christian ethics. The earth crisis cannot be understood apart from the larger human crisis&#x2014;economic equity, social values, and human purpose are bound up with the planet's survival. In a sense, she says, the whole earth is a moral community. Reorienting Christian ethics from its usual anthropocentrism to an ecocentrism entails a new framework that Moe-Lobeda lays out in her first chapters, culminating in a creative rethinking of how it is that we understand morally. With this "moral epistemology" in place, she unfolds her notion of "moral vision" and applies it to the present situation in a full-fledged earth-honoring, justice-seeking Christian ethical stance.</p><p>Cynthia D. Moe-Lobeda teaches Christian ethics at Seattle University&#39;s School of Theology and Ministry and in the Department of Theology and Religious Studies. She is author of Healing a Broken World (Fortress Press, 2002) and Public Church: For the Life of the World (Lutheran Voices, 2004) and is co-author of Saint Francis and the Foolishness of God (Orbis, 1993) and Say to This Mountain: Mark&#39;s Story of Discipleship (Orbis, 1996)."This book is a gift to all .... consumers looking for a way out of their addiction. Those of us (myself included) who know our excessive consumption is causing ecological and economic disasters should read Professor Moe-Lobeda's new book. It is the best one-volume analysis of our moral dilemma I know of and, even better, it suggests principles and practices to help deal with it." --Sallie McFague, Vancouver School of Theology<br><br>"Cynthia Moe-Lobeda's <i>Resisting Structural Evil: Love as Ecological and Economic Transformation</i> takes the form of a powerful contribution to Christian ethics, but in fact it is also a major contribution to anyone in any religious or spiritual tradition who seeks to maintain both a commitment to God and to global healing and transformation. Easily accessible and charming in presentation, deep in its ability to confront difficult issues squarely and in a nuanced way, courageous in insisting that we see reality not only as it is but as it could be if we were willing to be "unrealistic" for a few moments, manifesting daring of thought combined with a pervasive humility this is a true classic of spiritual progressive consciousness, packed full of ideas that should be taught in every college and university and religious seminary, every church, synagogue, mosque and ashram!" --Rabbi Michael Lerner, Editor of Tikkun Magazine, Chair of The Network of Spiritual Progressives<br><br>"This is a grand prophetic book motivated by love and focused on justice social justice, ecological justice, and dignity for &#x2018;the least of these.&#x2019; Don't miss it!" --Cornel West, Union Theological Seminary</p><h2>Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach</h2><p>By delving into the intricate and immutable laws of nature, as well as opposing beliefs, the author presents a Christian response to science that urges the world to pay tribute to the God who created nature and cares for it.

What remains of his work-from futuristic designs and scientific inquiry to artwork of ethereal beauty-reveals the ambitious, unpredictable brilliance of a visionary, and a timeless dreamer.<p>Robert Byrd celebrates this passionate, playful genius in a glowing picture book replete with the richness and imagination of Leonardo's own notebooks. Twenty lavish spreads, including side drawings, supplemental texts, and quotes from Leonardo's writings, highlight distinct periods and make the master's art, jokes, explorations, and inventions wonderfully vivid and accessible. A striking tribute to an irrepressible mind and to the potential within all who are curious.</p></p><p>Mr. Byrd is a successful commercial artist and children's book illustrator whose award-winning picture books include <i>The Bear and the Bird King</i>.

Robert Byrd lives in Haddonfield, New Jersey.Gr. 4-6. This vision of da Vinci's life, work, and dreams is a celebration of the Renaissance artist's genius. The large-size format with bordered spreads and a variety of framed insets was inspired by the style of Leonardo's own distinctive notebooks, and it incorporates many quotes. Spread captions allow spot reading, but their tiny print demands concentration. The detailed pen-and-colored-ink illustrations create layers of information juxtaposing facts and anecdotes. Diane Stanley's <i>Leonardo da Vinci </i>(1996) presents the time period in an elegant, graceful style, while Byrd saturates his scenes with images to suggest da Vinci's mind overflowing with ideas and questions. The extensive back matter (some in even smaller print) includes an author's note, a lengthy time line, a bibliography that includes Web sites, and sources for the illustrations. Effective book design is carried out even to the endpapers, which are patterned with quotes in tiny simulated handwriting. An impressive tribute to a man whose curiosity and artistic imagination amazed the world, then and now. <i>Julie Cummins</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Mankind was nearly eradicated by the seemingly unstoppable beasts, until the gods sent the great hero, Ramrowan, to save them. He united the tribes, gave them magic, and drove the demons into the sea. Ever since the land has belonged to man and the oceans have remained an uncrossable hell, leaving the continent of Lok isolated. It was prophesized that someday the demons would return, and only the descendants of Ramrowan would be able to defeat them. They became the first kings, and all men served those who were their only hope for survival.&nbsp;<br> <br> As centuries passed the descendants of the great hero grew in number and power. They became tyrannical and cruel, and their religion nothing but an excuse for greed. Gods and demons became myth and legend, and the people no longer believed. The castes created to serve the Sons of Ramrowan rose up and destroyed their rulers. All religion was banned and replaced by a code of unflinching law. The surviving royalty and their priests were made casteless, condemned to live as untouchables, and the Age of Law began.&nbsp;<br> <br> Ashok Vadal has been chosen by a powerful ancient weapon to be its bearer. He is a Protector, the elite militant order of roving law enforcers. No one is more merciless in rooting out those who secretly practice the old ways. Everything is black or white, good or evil, until he discovers his entire life is a fraud. Ashok isn&#x2019;t who he thinks he is, and when he finds himself on the wrong side of the law, the consequences lead to rebellion, war&#x2014;and destruction.<br> <br> <b>About&nbsp;<i>Son of the Black Sword:</i></b><br> "This book has everything I like in fantasy: intense action scenes, evil in horrifying array, good struggling against the darkness, and most of all people&#x2014;gorgeously flawed human beings faced with horrible moral choices that force them to question and change and grow."&#x2014;Jim Butcher, creator of the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling Dresden Files<br> <br> "Best-selling fantasy author Correia casts a compelling spell with this India-influenced series opener. . . .

He had seen a telltale flash of light in the distance when he had stopped for grub around noon, just a tiny bright flicker that had lasted only a split second, but that had been enough to alert him. Maybe it had been the sun glinting off a buckle or a shiny spur. Whoever was back there had been just a little careless, and now they had lost the advantage of surprise.<br><br>Rafe McCay hadn't panicked; he had continued to ride as if he had nowhere in particular to go and all the time in the world to get there. It would be getting dark soon, and he decided he'd better find out who was tracking him before he made camp for the night. Besides, according to his calculations the tracker should be exposed on that long tree-line trail just about now. McCay got the field glass out of his saddlebag and stepped into the shadow of a big pine, making certain that no reflection could give him away, too. He trained the glass on the trail where he estimated the tracker would be and soon spotted the man: one rider on a dark brown horse with a right front stocking. The man was holding the horse to a walk and leaning over to examine the trail as they went. McCay had come that way himself an hour or so before.<br><br>Something about the rider was familiar. McCay kept the glass trained on the distant figure, trying to trigger his memory, but he couldn't get a good look at the man's face. Maybe it was the way he sat in the saddle, or maybe even the horse itself that gave McCay a gnawing sense that somewhere down the line he'd seen or met this particular man, and that he hadn't liked what he'd learned. But he just couldn't bring the man's name to mind. The rig on the horse wasn't unusual, and there was nothing about the man's clothes that was out of the ordinary, except maybe for his flat-crowned black hat trimmed with silver conchas -- <br><br>Trahern.<br><br>McCay's breath hissed through his teeth.<br><br>The bounty on his head must have gotten pretty big, to attract someone like Trahern. Trahern's reputation was that he was a good tracker, a damn good shot, and that he never stopped, never gave up.<br><br>Four years of being hunted kept McCay from doing anything hasty or foolish. He had both time and surprise on his side, as well as experience. Trahern didn't know it, but the hunted had just become the hunter.<br><br>On the chance that Trahern might have a field glass, too, McCay remounted and rode deeper into the trees before circling back to the right, putting a small rise between him and his pursuer. If there was one thing the war had taught him, it was always to know the lay of the land, and he automatically chose courses that gave him, whenever possible, both cover and escape routes. He could cover his tracks and lose the bounty hunter here in the timber, but there was another thing the war had taught him: never leave an enemy on your back trail. If he didn't deal with it now, he'd have to deal with it later, when the circumstances might not be in his favor. Trahern had signed his own death warrant by trying to collect this particular bounty. McCay had long since lost any scruples about killing the men who came after him; it was a matter of his life or theirs, and he was damn tired of running.<br><br>When he had doubled back a mile, he left his horse concealed behind a rocky outcropping and made his way on foot to where he could see his original trail. By his calculations, the bounty hunter should be along within half an hour. McCay carried his rifle in a scabbard slung across his back. It was a repeater that he'd had for a couple of years now. It was plenty accurate for the distance, which was about sixty yards. He chose his cover, a big pine with a two-foot-high rock at the base of it, and settled into position to wait.<br><br>But the minutes ticked by, and Trahern didn't appear. McCay lay motionless and listened to the sounds around him. Birds were calling, undisturbed, having become accustomed to him since he hadn't moved for so long. Had something made Trahern suspicious? McCay couldn't think of anything he'd done. Maybe Trahern had just stopped to rest, cautiously putting more distance between himself and his quarry until he was ready to make his move. That was Trahern's way: biding his time until things suited him. McCay liked to operate that way himself. A lot of men had gotten themselves killed by taking the fight forward when the odds were against them.<br><br>Colonel Mosby had always said that Rafe McCay was the best he'd ever seen in ambush because he had patience and endurance. McCay could withstand discomfort, hunger, pain and boredom, divorcing his mind from it and concentrating instead on the job at hand. The growing darkness, however, opened up other possibilities. Trahern could have stopped and made camp for the night rather than try to follow a trail in the failing light. He might think it would be easier to spot a cook fire and just be lying back there biding his time; but Trahern was smart enough to know that a man on the run made do a lot of times with a cold camp, and only a damn fool slept by a fire anyway. A man stayed alive by building a small fire to cook, then putting it out and moving to another location to bed down.<br><br>McCay's own choices now were to stay right where he was and pick Trahern off whenever he <i>did</i> come down the trail, backtrack a bit more and try to find Trahern at his own camp, or use the darkness to put even more distance between them.<br><br>His horse whickered softly down by the rocks, and McCay swore violently to himself. He heard an answering whinny immediately, and the second call was right behind him. McCay reacted instantly, rolling and bringing the barrel of the rifle around. Trahern was about twenty yards behind and to his left, and it was a toss-up which of them was the most surprised. Trahern had cleared leather, but he was looking in the wrong direction, down toward McCay's horse. McCay's movement brought him swinging around, and McCay got off the first shot, but Trahern was already dodging to the side and the slug missed. Trahern's shot went wild.<br><br>The crest of the ridge was right behind McCay and he simply rolled over it, getting a mouthful of dirt and pine needles in the process, but that was better than taking a bullet. He spat the dirt out and got to his feet, bending low to keep the ridge line between him and Trahern. Silently he moved to his right, working his way back toward his horse.<br><br>He wasn't in a good mood. Damn it, what was Trahern doing wandering away from the trail like that? The bounty hunter hadn't been expecting anything, or he wouldn't have been so surprised at finding his prey right under his nose. Well, hell, sometimes even the best traps didn't work, but now Trahern was right on him and he'd lost the advantage of surprise.<br><br>He gained the shelter of another big pine and went down on one knee behind it, holding himself still and quiet while he listened. He was in a mess and he knew it. All Trahern had to do was settle down where he could watch McCay's horse, and McCay was trapped, too. His only chance was to spot Trahern before Trahern spotted him, and a lot of men had died trying to do that very thing.<br><br>Then a humorless smile lifted the corners of his hard mouth. There were only a few minutes of light left. If Trahern wanted to see who could snake around better in the dark, McCay was happy to oblige him.<br><br>He closed his eyes and let his ears catch every sound without the distraction of sight to dilute the message. He noticed a gradual increase in the chirping of insects and tree frogs, as the nighttime denizens went about their business. When he opened his eyes again, about ten minutes later, his sight had already adjusted to the darkness and he could easily make out the outlines of trees and bushes.<br><br>McCay slipped pine needles through his spurs to keep them from jingling and replaced the rifle in the scabbard on his back; the long gun would be too awkward to hold while crawling around in the dark. He removed his revolver from the holster, then eased down onto his belly and snake-crawled toward the cover of a clump of bushes.<br><br>The iciness of the ground beneath him reminded him that winter hadn't completely released its grip on the land yet. During the comparative warmth of the day he had taken off his coat and tied it to the back of his saddle. Now that the sun had set, the temperature was plunging.<br><br>He'd been cold before, and the pungent smell of pine needles reminded him that he'd crawled on his belly more than once, too. Back in '63, he'd completely circled a Yankee patrol on his belly, moving not three feet behind one guard, then returned to Mosby and reported the patrol's strength and the placement of the guards. He'd also snaked through the mud one rainy November night with a bullet in his leg and the Yankees beating the bushes for him. Only the fact that he'd been so thoroughly coated with mud had enabled him to escape capture that time.<br><br>It took him half an hour to ease back to the crest of the ridge and slide over it as sinuously as a snake going into a river. There he paused once again, letting his eyes go unfocused while he examined the surrounding trees for a shape that didn't belong, his ears listening for the stamp of a hoof or a horse's snuffle. If Trahern was as smart as he was supposed to be, he'd have moved the horses, but maybe he'd been too wary to show himself like that.<br><br>How long could Trahern stay alert, all his senses straining? The effort exhausted most men if they weren't used to it. McCay was so used to it that he didn't even have to think about it anymore. The past four years hadn't been much different from the war, except that he was alone now, and he wasn't liberating payrolls, arms, or horseflesh from Union soldiers. And if he was caught now, he wouldn't be released in a prisoner exchange; he'd never make it to any sort of lawman alive. The bounty on his head, dead or alive, guaranteed that.<br><br>He let well over an hour lapse before, moving one muscle at a time, an inch at a time, he began working his way closer to the rocky outcropping where he'd left his horse, stopping every few feet to listen. It was slow going; it took over half an hour to cover fifty feet, and he estimated he had at least a hundred yards to go. Finally he caught the faint scrape of a horseshoe on rock as an animal shifted its weight, and the deep, sighing sound of a sleeping horse. He couldn't see either his horse or Trahern's, but the direction of the sounds told him that his horse was still where he'd left it. Trahern must have decided not to take the risk of exposing himself long enough to move the animals.<br><br>The question now was, where was Trahern? Somewhere with a clear view of McCay's horse. Somewhere that afforded cover for himself. And was he still alert, or had his senses dulled from the strain? Was he getting sleepy?<br><br>McCay calculated that it had been about five hours since Trahern had walked up on him, which would make it only about ten o'clock. Trahern was too good to let himself relax his guard this soon. The early morning hours were when the senses dulled and defenses tumbled, when the eyelids were lined with grit and weighed about forty pounds each, when the mind was numb with exhaustion.<br><br>But wouldn't Trahern, knowing that McCay would know this, expect him to wait? Wouldn't Trahern feel fairly safe in snatching an hour or so of sleep now, reasoning that any try for the horse would come right before dawn? Or that startling a dozing horse would make enough racket to awaken him?<br><br>McCay grinned, feeling the recklessness flood through him. Hell, he might as well stand up and walk right up to the horse. The odds were the same no matter what he did. When it looked as if he was damned if he did and damned if he didn't, he'd learned that the most reckless choice was the one with the best chance of succeeding.<br><br>He worked his way closer to the outcropping that sheltered the horse, then waited until the shifting sounds told him that the animal had awakened. He waited a few more minutes, then rose silently to his feet and walked up to the big bay, who caught his scent and affectionately butted him with his head. McCay rubbed the velvety soft nose, then gathered the reins and as quietly as possible swung up into the saddle. His blood was racing through his veins the way it always did at times like this, and he had to clench his teeth to keep from venting his tension in a bloodcurdling yell. The horse quivered under him, sensing his savage enjoyment of the risk he was taking.<br><br>It took iron self-control to turn the horse and calmly walk it away, but the ground was too uneven to risk even a trot. Now was the most dangerous time, when Trahern was most likely to be awakened -- <br><br>He heard the snick of a hammer being thumbed back and instantly bent low over the horse's neck as he reined it sharply to the right and kicked its flanks. He felt the sharp burning in his left side a split second before he heard the shot. The muzzle flash pinpointed Trahern's position, and McCay had drawn and fired before Trahern could get another shot off. Then the big horse bolted, encouraged by another thud from McCay's bootheel, and the darkness swallowed them. He could hear Trahern's curses even over the thunder of his horse's hooves.<br><br>Concern for both their necks made him rein in the horse before they'd gone a quarter of a mile. His side was burning like hell, and wetness was seeping down the side of his pants. His horse at a walk, McCay pulled off his glove with his teeth and felt around, finding two holes in his shirt and corresponding holes in his body where the bullet had entered and exited. He yanked his bandanna from around his neck and wadded it up inside his shirt, using his elbow to keep it pressed to the wounds.<br><br>Damn, he was cold! A convulsive shudder started in his boots and rolled all the way up his body, shaking him like a wet dog and nearly making him pass out from the pain. He put his glove back on and untied his coat from the bedroll, then shrugged into the heavy fleece-lined garment. The shivers continued, and the wetness spread down his left leg. The son of a bitch hadn't hit anything vital, but he was losing a lot of blood.<br><br>The guessing game started again. Trahern would probably expect him to ride hard and fast, putting as much distance between them as he could manage by sunrise. McCay figured he'd gone about a mile when he walked the horse into a thick stand of pines and dismounted. He gave the animal a handful of feed and some water, patted his neck in appreciation of his steadiness, and untied the bedroll. He had to get the bleeding stopped, and get warm, or Trahern was going to find him lying unconscious on the trail.<br><br>Keeping the canteen of water beside him, he wrapped up in the blanket and settled down on the thick layer of pine needles, lying on his left side so his weight would put pressure on the back wound while he pressed the heel of his hand over the exit wound in front. The position made him grunt with pain, but he figured the discomfort was better than bleeding to death. Sleeping was out of the question. Even if the pain would let him, he didn't dare let himself relax.<br><br>He hadn't eaten since noon, but he wasn't hungry. He drank a little water every now and then and watched the glimmer of the stars through the heavy tree cover overhead. He listened for any sounds of pursuit, though he didn't really expect Trahern to come after him so soon. The night held only natural sounds.<br><br>Gradually he began to warm, and the hot pain in his side subsided to a dull throb. His shirt was stiffening, which meant the flow of fresh blood had stopped. It was hard...</p><h2>Heat and Dust</h2><p>A profound and powerful novel, winner of the Booker Prize<br>Set in colonial India during the 1920s, Heat and Dust tells the story of Olivia, a beautiful woman suffocated by the propriety and social constraints of her position as the wife of an important English civil servant.

She had to come down to Katie's ear to be heard so close to the sound system. A drunken frat boy from Omaha was in the midst of a soulful Alice Cooper song, the bar was full and the noise level was high.<br><br>Katie shrugged and grinned, looking up at her friend. Maybe she was taking on too much, but an opportunity had come up, and she hadn't been able to resist.<br><br>"It will be wonderful, it will work out&#x2014;and it will be good for Key West," Katie said in return.<br><br>Clarinda arched a doubtful brow, set down a glass of water with lime on the small table at Katie's side and shook her head. "I'll help you, of course," she said. "And, you know, Danny Zigler will be delighted to come and work for you. He was heartbroken when the place shut down years ago. People say that it's haunted, of course. You know that, right?"<br><br>"So I've heard," Katie said.<br><br>"Sweetie, can we get another round over here?" a man shouted above the din.<br><br>"Just don't call me sweetie," Clarinda said, exhaling a sigh of exasperation. "What is this tonight? We usually get the locals who actually know how to hold their liquor."<br><br>"Gee. We're in Key West and we've been discovered by tourists. Go figure," Katie said.<br><br>"Yeah, well, I wish I were the karaoke hostess and not the waitress," Clarinda said.<br><br>"Hey, I've told you that you can work for me&#x2014;"<br><br>"And when the place is slow and the hostess is supposed to sing, I assure you that I'll clean out not just the bar, but the entire street.

"Another round!"<br><br>"He's going to get the round on top of his head," Clarinda promised and strode toward the bar.<br><br>The Alice Cooper tune was winding down.

What was it with tonight? It was true&#x2014;the strange and totally inebriated seemed to be coming out of the woodwork. Well, it was Key West. Home to some, but mainly a tourist town where the primary activity was drinking too much.<br><br>Key West has much more to offer, she thought, defending her native territory. The fishing was excellent, diving was spectacular and many visitors came for the water sports. But it was true as well that young and old flocked from far and wide to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville for the sheer pleasure of a bachelor party, or just wild nights along Duval. Duval was the hub of nightlife, and it was the main place for cheap hotel rooms.<br><br>Her place&#x2014;or her uncle Jamie's place, O'Hara's, where she ran Katie-oke&#x2014;was off the southern end of Duval while most of the more popular watering holes were at the northern end.

She operated Katie-oke four nights a week. She also worked at O'Hara's when she wasn't doing karaoke, helping set the sound and stage for performers working on their own music, or doing easy acoustic and vocal numbers on Monday and Tuesday nights.<br><br>She had received a degree from Juilliard and taken work with a prestigious theater company in New England, and she had loved New England, but it hadn't been home. She'd eventually discovered that she couldn't take snow and sleet, and wanted to make her living in Key West.<br><br>She realized that she was good at the heat, good at sweating.

She was in Old Town, and surrounded by tourism. She got her fill of water, however, because one of her best friends, an old high-school mate, Jonas Weston, now dating Clarinda, owned and operated the Salvage Inn, a place on the Gulf side with its own little stretch of man-made beach. She was welcome there, whenever she wanted to go.<br><br>"Those fellows are being quite obnoxious. Want me to take one of them out?"<br><br>Katie heard the question, but she didn't even look over at the speaker. Bartholomew knew that he irritated her when he decided to converse in the company of others.<br><br>Unaware of Bartholomew casually and handsomely draped upon a bar stool near Katie, Marty Jenkins, local pirate entertainer, came to her side. "Will you play a sea-shanty disc for me, Katie?"<br><br>"Of course, Marty," she said.<br><br>He handed her his disc and she slid it into her system. "No words can come up on the screen, Marty. But you don't need them, right?"<br><br>He grinned. "Gearing up for the next pirate show, my sweet. No words needed. Thanks."<br><br>"I'm sure everyone will love it, Marty."<br><br>"Hey, I heard you bought the old wax museum, Katie," Marty said.<br><br>"Marty, it's not a wax museum. It's full of robotics."<br><br>"Isn't that supposed to mean that they all move?" Marty asked.<br><br>"I believe that they all can move. They're just not operating right now."<br><br>"Actually, none of them work, from what I understand." Marty wagged a finger at her. "That place has been closed down for five years now. Craig Beckett tried to keep it going after that girl's body was found, but he threw in the towel. If you can get your money back, young lady, you ought to do it."<br><br>"I want to open it, Marty. I loved the place when I was a little kid," she told him.<br><br>He shook his head. "They say it's haunted, and not haunted by good. You know what happened there. Murder!"<br><br>"It was very sad, and a long time ago, Marty. What happened was tragic&#x2014;some idiot making use of someone else's dream for a dramatic effect, but it's all in the past now. I'll be all right, Marty."<br><br>"They never caught the killer, missy," he reminded her.<br><br>"And I'm thinking that the killer moved on, Marty. Nothing like it has happened again."<br><br>Still shaking his head, Marty left her.<br><br>"I think he must be right. It doesn't sound like a good place to be," Bartholomew informed her, leaning near and whispering, though why he whispered, she didn't know. "Hey! That man is still behaving in a rude and disrespectful way toward Clarinda. Should I do something about it?"<br><br>Katie grated her teeth and looked toward the bar and the revenant of the man who stood next to her. She was sure that to the rest of the people present, there was nothing to be seen.<br><br>Or heard.<br><br>She lowered her head and spoke in an intense whisper. "Bartholomew, if you wish to maintain a mortal friend, I entreat you to cease and desist&#x2014;shut up! You make me appear unbalanced, talking to myself all the time."<br><br>"That chap is an utter ass," Bartholomew protested. "Oh, and there <em>she </em>goes again, out on the street."<br><br>Katie looked up. She couldn't help herself.<br><br>It was true. A woman in white was walking along the sidewalk, staring straight ahead. She was in a Victorian white dress, and she knotted a handkerchief in her hands. She looked so sad that Katie felt a pang in her heart, and she bit her lower lip to remind herself that it was a curse seeing ghosts, that she couldn't become involved with all of them&#x2014;there were simply too many in Key West&#x2014;and that the woman was long dead and needed only to discover some kind of inner peace to move on.<br><br>"She haunts me so," Bartholomew said. He grimaced. "No pun intended."<br><br>Katie looked around as Bartholomew chuckled. His long-dead state did not seem to dampen his good spirits.<br><br>He'd been an adventurer in life&#x2014;and <em>a privateer, </em>not a pirate!&#x2014;and his sense of curiosity and longing for new experiences had not deserted him in death. He stared at Katie. "You really don't know who she is? And she won't talk to you?"<br><br>"She never has," Katie said.<br><br>"Watch it," Bartholomew warned.<br><br>She realized Clarinda was staring at her with concern in her eyes.<br><br>Katie knew that thus far in her life, only she seemed to be blessed by Bartholomew's presence.<br><br>He was quite the dandy. His shoes were buckled and bore heels, his hose didn't display a single knot and his breeches were impeccable. He wore a ruffled shirt, red vest and black jacket. His hair was jet-black and neatly queued beneath his tricornered hat. She knew he was especially fond of the Pirates in Paradise festival himself, and he insisted that they spend their time watching the musicians and joining in with the festivities because he loved to comment on the modern-day pirates roaming Key West.<br><br>"Are you all right?" Clarinda asked, coming back up to Katie's equipment stand and sidling around to stand next to her chair. "You're talking to yourself again," she warned. "One of the fellows over there wanted to buy you a drink. He thought you were already well on the way."<br><br>Katie looked over to the group where her would-be admirer was sitting. She frowned, recognizing the man, but not knowing why. "I don't want a drink&#x2014;thank him for me. I was singing under my breath to the song, that's all. Clarinda, who is that guy?"<br><br>Clarinda turned and waved a hand. The fellow shrugged. He had tawny-blond hair, a neatly trimmed beard and mustache, and appeared to be in his midthirties. He was so familiar, and not anyone she saw on a daily basis.<br><br>"He does look&#x2014;like we should know him, huh?"<br><br>"But I don't think he's a local," Katie said.<br><br>"Maybe he's on the news&#x2014;or a fishing show, or something like that," Clarinda suggested.<br><br>"Well, let's not make enemies. Tell him thanks for me but no thanks, and that I don't drink when I work. I was just humming and halfway singing along with the music," Katie said.<br><br>"Of course. And don't worry. I already told him that you didn't drink while you were working. He said all karaoke hosts drank. I said you didn't."<br><br>"Thanks. Just be pleasant to him. I can always take care of myself, honestly," Katie assured her.<br><br>"Indeed! Because I'm at your side," Bartholomew said. "And I can take my cutlass to any rat bastard's throat."<br><br>Katie glared at him.<br><br>"All right, all right, so I can't master a sword anymore. I can trip the bastard," Bartholomew assured her. "I'm quite an accomplished trip artist for a ghost, if I do say so myself."<br><br>"Lovely," Katie said.<br><br>"What's lovely?" Clarinda asked.<br><br>"That it's finally near closing time. Marty is about to come up. Oh, and it's thinning out, so...ah! I know what we'll do."<br><br>"Katie, I do not sing&#x2014;"<br><br>"It will be fine," Katie assured her. As she walked back to check on the state of her customers, Katie turned to Bartholomew. "Hush until I'm done here tonight, do you hear me? What fun will you have if they lock me up for insanity?"<br><br>"Here? In modern-day Key West? Oh, posh. I've yet to see an even semisane person living in or visiting the place," Bartholomew protested.<br><br>"Shut up now, and I mean it!" Katie warned.<br><br>Of course, what she could possibly do to him&#x2014;how to really threaten a ghost&#x2014;she didn't know herself. She'd been plagued for years and years by...whatever it was that allowed her to see those who had "crossed the veil into the light," as many seemed to term it.<br><br>Bartholomew sniffed indignantly and went to lean against the bar, his sense of humor returning as he crossed his arms over his chest and indulged in eavesdropping on everyone around him.<br><br>Soon after, Marty went up to do his new song, the crowd, a mix of locals and tourists, went wild and he invited everyone down for Fantasy Fest. Someone asked him about Fantasy Fest and Marty explained that it was kind of like Mardi Gras&#x2014;a king and queen were elected&#x2014;and kind of like Halloween, and kind of like the biggest, wildest party anyone could think of. Costumes, parties and special events all around the city. There was a parade with dressed up pets&#x2014; and <em>un</em>dressed people in body paint. It was fabulous, a feast and pure fantasy for the heart and the imagination.<br><br>He was proud of himself for his explanation. The next person asked about Pirates in Paradise, and Marty looked troubled. After thinking he said that it was kind of like Fantasy Fest but not&#x2014;there were pirate parties, pirate encampments, historical demonstrations&#x2014;and heck, a lot of swaggering and grog drinking, but people were welcome to wear costumes. They could see a mock trial of Anne Bonny, they could learn so much&#x2014;and run around, saying <em>arrgh, avast </em>and <em>ahoy </em>all day if they liked.<br><br>When the crowd finally began to thin around 3:00 a.m., Katie and Clarinda did a song together from <em>Jekyll and Hyde, </em>despite Clarinda's objections. Her friend had a lovely, strong voice but didn't believe it; she would only go up late at night and when it was fairly quiet, and only with Katie.<br><br>The bar didn't close up until 4:00 a.m., but Katie ended her karaoke at three, giving folks time to finish up and pay their bar tabs. After she had secured her equipment for the night&#x2014;she only had to see that the karaoke computer and all her amps were covered and that her good microphones were locked away&#x2014;she was ready to head home and to sleep. Clarinda stopped her at the door. "Hey, Jonas is coming by for me in an hour or so. We'll walk you home. Hang around."<br><br>Katie shook her head. "I'm fine, honestly. I grew up here, remember? I know how to avoid drunks and&#x2014;"<br><br>"We actually get gangs down here now, you know," Clarinda said firmly.<br><br>"I'm going straight home. I'll take Simonton, I won't walk on Duval. I'll be fine."<br><br>Clarinda remained unhappy, but Katie had no intention of being swayed. Her uncle was up in St. Augustine, and Jon Merrillo was managing the bar, so she intended to slip out without being stopped by anyone. On Saturday, she would officially take ownership of the Beckett family's myth-and-legends museum, and she was tense and wanted to be anywhere but at work. "You watch yourself with those drunks!" she warned.<br><br>"Oh, honey, if there's one thing I learned while you were away at school, it's how to handle drunks. Oh, wait! We both knew how to manage that before you left. Go. I'll be fine. And Jonas will be here soon."<br><br>Waving and clutching her carryall, Katie left the bar.<br><br></p><h2>Special Education: Contemporary Perspectives for School Professionals</h2><p><b>Real teachers, real families and students, and real classrooms&nbsp;bring the field of Special Education to life.</b> <p> <b> <i>Special Education: Contemporary Perspectives for School Professionals</i>,&nbsp;</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>&nbsp;Edition,&nbsp;</b>provides a multi-dimensional view of the field of special education.

Christopher Knight and Alan Butler realized that the ancient system of geometry they presented in their earlier, breakthrough study works as perfectly for the Moon as it does the Earth. They found a consistent sequence of integer numbers that they can apply to every major aspect of the Moon; no such pattern emerges for any other planet or moon in the solar system. In addition, Knight and Butler discovered that the Moon possesses few or no heavy metals and has no core&#x2014;something that should not be possible. Their persuasive conclusion: if higher life only developed on Earth because the Moon is exactly <i>what</i> it is and <i>where</i> it is, it becomes unreasonable to cling to the idea that the Moon is a natural object&#x2014;an idea with profound implications.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Christopher Knight has written five very successful books. His first book, The Hiram Key, co-authored with Robert Lomas, was published in 1996 and it immediately went into the UK top ten, bestseller list and remained there for 8 consecutive weeks. It has since been translated into 37 languages and sold over a million copies worldwide, becoming a bestseller in several countries. Alan Butler, a qualified engineer, but always fascinated by history made himself into something of an expert in astrology and astronomy. He has published four successful books on the Knights Templar and the Grail legend. He is also a published playwright and a very successful radio dramatist.

Do you interact with someone who is? Contrary to popular belief, narcissists do not love themselves or anyone else. They cannot accept their true selves, constructing instead fixed masks that hide emotional numbness. Influenced by forces in culture and predisposed by factors in the human personality, narcissists tend to be <br> � More concerned with how they appear than what they feel <br> � Seductive and manipulative, striving for power and control <br> � Egotists, focused on their own interests but lacking the true values of the self -- self-expression, self-possession, dignity, and integrity <br> � Without a solid sense of self, which leads them to experience life as empty and meaningless <br> In this groundbreaking study, Dr. Alexander Lowen uses his extensive clinical experience to demonstrate how narcissists can recover their suppressed feelings and regain their lost humanity.

In 1955, in Caroline County, Virginia, amidst segregation and prejudice, injustice and cruelty, two teenagers fell in love. Their life together broke the law, but their determination would change it. Richard and Mildred Loving were at the heart of a Supreme Court case that legalized marriage between races, and a story of the devoted couple who faced discrimination, fought it, and won.</p><p>Patricia Hruby Powell's previous book, <em>Josephine: The Dazzling Life of Josephine Baker</em>, won a Sibert Honor for Nonfiction, a Coretta Scott King Honor, and five starred reviews. She lives in Illinois.<br><br>Shadra Strickland is an illustrator whose work has won an Ezra Jack Keats Award, a Coretta Scott King/John Steptoe Award for New Talent, and an NAACP Image Award. She lives in Maryland.Gr 8 Up&#x2014;This title, depicting the individuals and events surrounding a watershed moment in U.S. civil rights history, is immediately relevant today. In 1950s Virginia, Richard Loving and Mildred Jeter fell in love and wanted to marry and raise their family where they were brought up. This was a problem: Loving was white, Jeter was considered "colored," and there was a law prohibiting interracial marriage. Still, the couple married in DC anyway, and after returning to Virginia, they served jail time. After years of separation and fighting the ruling, they connected with ACLU lawyers, and in 1967 their case was heard by the Supreme Court, which unanimously overturned the previous judgment against the Lovings in a landmark ruling. Written in free verse, this docu-novel alternates perspectives between Richard and Mildred. News clippings, maps, and archival photos add immediacy and context, as do Strickland's moving illustrations, in the style of "visual journalism," which she explains in an appended note. The volume also features a time line of relevant events and an appended summary of the Lovings' lives after the case. The bibliography displays the author's extensive research, which included interviews with those who were connected to the couple, and the free-verse style personalizes the historical events, which reach directly into today's headlines. No single book can tell the whole story, of course, and this offers a rich opportunity for students and adults to discuss urgent and perennial questions: In any retelling of history, what has been left out? Is every story an open subject for every author? VERDICT A natural addition to any school or public library. With the new film Loving and the upcoming 50th anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court case, there will be increased attention on the Lovings' story.&#x2014;Kristin Anderson, Bloomingdale Public Library, IL</p><h2>How to Make Your Electric Guitar Play Great!</h2><p>From shopping for a first electric guitar to setting customized action, this do-it-yourself primer for owning and maintaining an electric guitar explains the ins and outs of choosing the right guitar; cleaning, tools, and basic maintenance; personalizing and improving on a &#x201c;factory setup;&#x201d; troubleshooting; basic guitar electronics; choosing and installing replacement pickups, pots, switches, and capacitors; setups of the pros; and much more.

On top of all that, the boys are upset because Allison has announced that only two of them will be invited to her birthday party, since if more than two boys come, they'll all start acting silly. You never know how things will add up at Wayside School.</p><p>Childhood Memories<br>As writer of books for elementary school students, Louis Sachar tries to recall what it felt like for him to be that age. Despite the notion that times have changed, he thinks that kids in grade school are basically the same as they were when he was young. <br>For example, in East Meadow, New York, where Sachar was born, he remembers having to keep away from the woods across the street to avoid the older, tough kids who played there. Looking back now, he thinks those tough kids were probably only eleven or twelve years old! When Sachar turned nine, his family moved to Orange County in California, which, at the time, was mostly orange groves. He cut through the orange groves on the way to school, and had orange fights on the way home. <br><br>The Path to Becoming an Author<br>It wasn't until high school that Sachar began to love reading. In college, he developed a particular interest in Russian literature and somehow got the ridiculous ambitious notion to learn the language and read his favorite Russian authors in the original language. After taking over a year of Russian, he realized it was still Greek to him. Sachar dropped out of Russian class and tried to figure out what class he should take instead. As he wandered across the campus, he saw an elementary school girl handing out pieces of paper. He took one from her. It read: 'Help. We need teachers' aides at our school. Earn three units of credit.' <br><br>Prior to that time, Sachar had no interest whatsoever in kids. However, he signed up to be a teacher's aide because he needed to take something other than Russian, and it sounded easy. It turned out to be not only his favorite class, but also the most important class Sachar took during his college career. After he was at the school for a while, he was asked to be the 'Noon Time Supervisor.' It was his job to watch over the kids during lunch. Sachar played games with the kids who all called him 'Louis, the Yard Teacher.' <br><br>The Story Behind Sideways Stories<br>Around that time Sachar came upon In Our Town by Damon Runyon, a book of very short stories about different characters in a town. It gave him the idea for Sideways Stories from Wayside School, which is a book of short stories about different kids in a school. All the kids are named after kids he knew at the school where he worked. 'Louis the Yard Teacher,' is also a character. Sachar says he had more fun writing that book than any of his others, because it was just a hobby then, and he never truly expected to be published. <br><br>A Career Choice <br>Sideways Stories from Wayside School was published just as Sachar began law school. For six years he struggled over trying to decide between being an author or a lawyer. During the time that he finished law school and took a job as a lawyer, Sachar wrote three more children's books. His decision had been made. Sachar has been an attorney since 1981, but has chosen to devote his time to writing children's books.&#34;A delightful collection of ingenious tales, all of which are touched with impossibility and hilarity...Full of wonderful characters and sentiment, the book has great messages for all in each chapter.

He lives near New York City.<p>Introduction<br>An Operation, Not an Aberration </p> <p>On January 21, 1971, a Vietnam veteran named Charles McDuff wrote a letter to President Richard Nixon to voice his disgust with the American war in Southeast Asia. McDuff had witnessed multiple cases of Vietnamese civilians being abused and killed by American soldiers and their allies, and he had found the U.S. military justice system to be woefully ineffective in punishing wrongdoers. &#x201c;Maybe your advisors have not clued you in,&#x201d; he told the president, &#x201c;but the atrocities that were committed in Mylai are eclipsed by similar American actions throughout the country.&#x201d; His three-page handwritten missive concluded with an impassioned plea to Nixon to end American participation in the war.1 </p> <p>The White House forwarded the note to the Department of Defense for a reply, and within a few weeks Major General Franklin Davis Jr., the army&#x2019;s director of military personnel policies, wrote back to McDuff. It was &#x201c;indeed unfortunate,&#x201d; said Davis, &#x201c;that some incidents occur within combat zones.&#x201d; He then shifted the burden of responsibility for what had happened firmly back onto the veteran. &#x201c;I presume,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;that you promptly reported such actions to the proper authorities.&#x201d; Other than a paragraph of information on how to contact the U.S. Army criminal investigators, the reply was only four sentences long and included a matter-of-fact reassurance: &#x201c;The United States Army has never condoned wanton killing or disregard for human life.&#x201d;2 </p> <p>This was, and remains, the American military&#x2019;s official position. In many ways, it remains the popular understanding in the United States as a whole. Today, histories of the Vietnam War regularly discuss war crimes or civilian suffering only in the context of a single incident: the My Lai massacre cited by McDuff. Even as that one event has become the subject of numerous books and articles, all the other atrocities perpetrated by U.S. soldiers have essentially vanished from popular memory. </p> <p>The visceral horror of what happened at My Lai is undeniable. On the evening of March 15, 1968, members of the Americal Division&#x2019;s Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry, were briefed by their commanding officer, Captain Ernest Medina, on a planned operation the next day in an area they knew as &#x201c;Pinkville.&#x201d; As unit member Harry Stanley recalled, Medina &#x201c;ordered us to &#x2018;kill everything in the village.&#x2019; &#x201d; Infantryman Salvatore LaMartina remembered Medina&#x2019;s words only slightly differently: they were to &#x201c;kill everything that breathed.&#x201d; What stuck in artillery forward observer James Flynn&#x2019;s mind was a question one of the other soldiers asked: &#x201c;Are we supposed to kill women and children?&#x201d; And Medina&#x2019;s reply: &#x201c;Kill everything that moves.&#x201d;3 </p> <p>The next morning, the troops clambered aboard helicopters and were airlifted into what they thought would be a &#x201c;hot LZ&#x201d;&#x2014;a landing zone where they&#x2019;d be under hostile fire. As it happened, though, instead of finding Vietnamese adversaries spoiling for a fight, the Americans entering My Lai encountered only civilians: women, children, and old men. Many were still cooking their breakfast rice. Nevertheless, Medina&#x2019;s orders were followed to a T. Soldiers of Charlie Company killed. They killed everything. They killed everything that moved. </p> <p>Advancing in small squads, the men of the unit shot chickens as they scurried about, pigs as they bolted, and cows and water buffalo lowing among the thatch-roofed houses. They gunned down old men sitting in their homes and children as they ran for cover. They tossed grenades into homes without even bothering to look inside. An officer grabbed a woman by the hair and shot her point-blank with a pistol. A woman who came out of her home with a baby in her arms was shot down on the spot. As the tiny child hit the ground, another GI opened up on the infant with his M-16 automatic rifle. </p> <p>Over four hours, members of Charlie Company methodically slaughtered more than five hundred unarmed victims, killing some in ones and twos, others in small groups, and collecting many more in a drainage ditch that would become an infamous killing ground. They faced no opposition. They even took a quiet break to eat lunch in the midst of the carnage. Along the way, they also raped women and young girls, mutilated the dead, systematically burned homes, and fouled the area&#x2019;s drinking water.4 </p> <p>There were scores of witnesses on the ground and still more overhead, American officers and helicopter crewmen perfectly capable of seeing the growing piles of civilian bodies. Yet when the military released the first news of the assault, it was portrayed as a victory over a formidable enemy force, a legitimate battle in which 128 enemy troops were killed without the loss of a single American life.5 In a routine congratulatory telegram, General William Westmoreland, the commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam, lauded the &#x201c;heavy blows&#x201d; inflicted on the enemy. His prot�g�, the commander of the Americal Division, added a special note praising Charlie Company&#x2019;s &#x201c;aggressiveness.&#x201d;6 </p> <p>Despite communiqu�s, radio reports, and English-language accounts released by the Vietnamese revolutionary forces, the My Lai massacre would remain, to the outside world, an American victory for more than a year. And the truth might have remained hidden forever if not for the perseverance of a single Vietnam veteran named Ron Ridenhour. The twenty-two-year-old Ridenhour had not been among the hundred American troops at My Lai, though he had seen civilians murdered elsewhere in Vietnam; instead, he heard about the slaughter from other soldiers who had been in Pinkville that day. Unnerved, Ridenhour took the unprecedented step of carefully gathering testimony from multiple American eyewitnesses. Then, upon returning to the United States after his yearlong tour of duty, he committed himself to doing whatever was necessary to expose the incident to public scrutiny.7 </p> <p>Ridenhour&#x2019;s efforts were helped by the painstaking investigative reporting of Seymour Hersh, who published newspaper articles about the massacre; by the appearance in Life magazine of grisly full-color images that army photographer Ron Haeberle captured in My Lai as the slaughter was unfolding; and by a confessional interview that a soldier from Charlie Company gave to CBS News. The Pentagon, for its part, consistently fought to minimize what had happened, claiming that reports by Vietnamese survivors were wildly exaggerated. At the same time, the military focused its attention on the lowest-ranking officer who could conceivably shoulder the blame for such a nightmare: Charlie Company&#x2019;s Lieutenant William Calley.8 </p> <p>An army inquiry into the killings eventually determined that thirty individuals were involved in criminal misconduct during the massacre or its cover-up. Twenty-eight of them were officers, including two generals, and the inquiry concluded they had committed a total of 224 serious offenses.9 But only Calley was ever convicted of any wrongdoing. He was sentenced to life in prison for the premeditated murder of twenty-two civilians, but President Nixon freed him from prison and allowed him to remain under house arrest. He was eventually paroled after serving just forty months, most of it in the comfort of his own quarters.10 </p> <p>The public response generally followed the official one. Twenty-five years later, Ridenhour would sum it up this way. </p> <p>At the end of it, if you ask people what happened at My Lai, they would say: &#x201c;Oh yeah, isn&#x2019;t that where Lieutenant Calley went crazy and killed all those people?&#x201d; No, that was not what happened. Lieutenant Calley was one of the people who went crazy and killed a lot of people at My Lai, but this was an operation, not an aberration.11 </p> <p>Looking back, it&#x2019;s clear that the real aberration was the unprecedented and unparalleled investigation and exposure of My Lai. No other American atrocity committed during the war&#x2014;and there were so many&#x2014;was ever afforded anything approaching the same attention. Most, of course, weren&#x2019;t photographed, and many were not documented in any way. The great majority were never known outside the offending unit, and most investigations that did result were closed, quashed, or abandoned. Even on the rare occasions when the allegations were seriously investigated within the military, the reports were soon buried in classified files without ever seeing the light of day.12 Whistle-blowers within the ranks or recently out of the army were threatened, intimidated, smeared, or&#x2014;if they were lucky&#x2014;simply marginalized and ignored. </p> <p>Until the My Lai revelations became front-page news, atrocity stories were routinely disregarded by American journalists or excised by stateside editors. The fate of civilians in rural South Vietnam did not merit much examination; even the articles that did mention the killing of noncombatants generally did so merely in passing, without any indication that the acts described might be war crimes.13 Vietnamese revolutionary sources, for their part, detailed hundreds of massacres and large-scale operations that resulted in thousands of civilian deaths, but those reports were dismissed out of hand as communist propaganda.14 </p> <p>And then, in a stunning reversal, almost immediately after the exposure of the My Lai massacre, war crime allegations became old hat&#x2014;so commonplace as to be barely worth mentioning or looking into. In leaflets, pamphlets, small-press books, and &#x201c;underground&#x201d; newspapers, the growing American antiwar movement repeatedly pointed out that U.S. troops were committing atrocities on a regular basis. But what had been previously brushed aside as propaganda and leftist kookery suddenly started to be disregarded as yawn-worthy common knowledge, with little but the My Lai massacre in between.15 </p> <p>Such impulses only grew stronger in the years of the &#x201c;culture wars,&#x201d; when the Republican Party and an emboldened right wing rose to power. Until Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s presidency, the Vietnam War was generally seen as an American defeat, but even before taking office Reagan began rebranding the conflict as &#x201c;a noble cause.&#x201d; In the same spirit, scholars and veterans began, with significant success, to recast the war in rosier terms.16 Even in the early years of the twenty-first century, as newspapers and magazines published expos�s of long-hidden U.S. atrocities, apologist historians continued to ignore much of the evidence, portraying American war crimes as no more than isolated incidents.17 </p> <p>But the stunning scale of civilian suffering in Vietnam is far beyond anything that can be explained as merely the work of some &#x201c;bad apples,&#x201d; however numerous. Murder, torture, rape, abuse, forced displacement, home burnings, specious arrests, imprisonment without due process&#x2014;such occurrences were virtually a daily fact of life throughout the years of the American presence in Vietnam. And as Ridenhour put it, they were no aberration. Rather, they were the inevitable outcome of deliberate policies, dictated at the highest levels of the military. </p> <p>The first official American combat troops arrived in Vietnam in 1965, but the roots of the conflict go back many decades earlier. In the nineteenth century, France expanded its colonial empire by taking control of Vietnam as well as neighboring Cambodia and Laos, rechristening the entire region as French Indochina. French rubber production in Vietnam yielded such riches for the colonizers that the latex oozing from rubber trees became known as &#x201c;white gold.&#x201d; The ill-paid Vietnamese workers, laboring on the plantations in harsh conditions, called it by a different name: &#x201c;white blood.&#x201d;18 </p> <p>By the early twentieth century, anger at the French had developed into a nationalist movement for independence. Its leaders found inspiration in communism, specifically the example of Russian Bolshevism and Lenin&#x2019;s call for national revolutions in the colonial world. During World War II, when Vietnam was occupied by the imperial Japanese, the country&#x2019;s main anticolonial organization&#x2014;officially called the League for the Independence of Vietnam, but far better known as the Viet Minh&#x2014;launched a guerrilla war against the Japanese forces and the French administrators running the country. Under the leadership of the charismatic Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese guerrillas aided the American war effort. In return they received arms, training, and support from the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, a forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency. </p> <p>In 1945, with the Japanese defeated, Ho proclaimed Vietnam&#x2019;s independence, using the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence as his template. &#x201c;All men are created equal,&#x201d; he told a crowd of half a million Vietnamese in Hanoi. &#x201c;The Creator has given us certain inviolable rights: the right to life, the right to be free, and the right to achieve happiness.&#x201d; As a young man Ho had spent some years living in the West, reportedly including stretches in Boston and New York City, and he hoped to obtain American support for his vision of a free Vietnam. In the aftermath of World War II, however, the United States was focused on rebuilding and strengthening a devastated Europe, as the Cold War increasingly gripped the continent. The Americans saw France as a strong ally against any Soviet designs on Western Europe and thus had little interest in sanctioning a communist-led independence movement in a former French colony. Instead, U.S. ships helped transport French troops to Vietnam, and the administration of President Harry Truman threw its support behind a French reconquest of Indochina. </p> <p>Soon, the United States was dispatching equipment and even military advisers to Vietnam. By 1953, it was shouldering nearly 80 percent of the bill for an ever more bitter war against the Viet Minh.19 The conflict progressed from guerrilla warfare to a conventional military campaign, and in 1954 a Gallic garrison at the well-fortified base of Dien Bien Phu was pounded into surrender by Viet Minh forces under General Vo Nguyen Giap. The French had had enough. At an international peace conference in Geneva, they agreed to a temporary separation of Vietnam into two placeholder regions, the north and the south, which were to be rejoined as one nation following a reunification election in 1956. </p> <p>That election never took place. Fearing that Ho Chi Minh, now the head of the communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north, was sure to sweep any nationwide vote, the United States picked up where its French partners had left off. It promptly launched efforts to thwart reunification by arming its allies in the southern part of the country. In this way, it fostered the creation of what eventually became the Republic of Vietnam, led by a Catholic autocrat named Ngo Dinh Diem. </p> <p>From the 1950s on, the United States would support an ever more corrupt and repressive state in South Vietnam while steadily expanding its presence in Southeast Asia. When President John Kennedy took office there were around 800 U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam. That number increased to 3,000 in 1961, and to more than 11,000 the following year. Officially listed as advisers involved in the training of the South Vietnamese army, the Americans increasingly took part in combat operations against southern guerrillas&#x2014;both communist and noncommunist&#x2014;who were now waging war to unify the country.20 </p> <p>After Kennedy&#x2019;s assassination, President Lyndon Johnson repeatedly escalated the war with bombing raids on North Vietnam, and unleashed an ever more furious onslaught on the South. In 1965 the fiction of &#x201c;advisers&#x201d; was finally dropped, and the American War, as it is known in Vietnam, began in earnest. In a televised speech, Johnson insisted that the United States was not inserting itself into a faraway civil war but ta...</p></p><h2>The Courage and Character of Theodore Roosevelt: A Hero Among Leaders</h2><p>The faith and character of Theodore Roosevelt are examined in context with his life and achievements in this biography.</p><p>GEORGE GRANT is director of King&#39;s Meadow Study Center, editor of the STIRLING BRIDGE newsletter, president of the Covenant Classical School Association and professor of moral philosophy at Bannockburn College.

But his sponsor Jarlaxle grows ever more ambitious, and Entreri struggles to remain cautious and in control. Soon, the power of the malevolent Crystal Shard grows greater than them both, threatening to draw them into a vast web of treachery from which there will be no escape.</p><p>Think of it as <i>Drowfellas</i>. Backstabbing and internecine intrigue abound as the ambitious members of a shady organization (in this case, the dark-elf mercenary band Bregan D'aerthe) vie for power, struggle to fend off reprisals, and generally cause all sorts of trouble. Themes of redemption and moral metamorphosis keep the plot moving, accompanied by intermittent bursts of spectacular, cinematic violence.<p> <i>The Servant of the Shard</i>, the immediate follow-up to <i>The Spine of the World</i> and <i>The Silent Blade</i>, is the long-awaited exposition on the history of Artemis Entreri. But perhaps more importantly, <i>Servant of the Shard</i> brings us the brilliant, bang-up pairing of master assassin Entreri and Bregan D'aerthe godfather Jarlaxle, filling out a deadly triangle with the bloodthirsty artifact Crenshinibon. (The rest--more magic items, tons of cool spells and psionics thanks to Rai-guy and Kimmuriel Oblodra, cameos from <i>The Cleric Quintet</i>, and a blow-out finale with an ancient red dragon--well, that's all just icing on the cake.)</p><p> The big question, which hopefully won't have to be asked again after this title: Can Bob Salvatore really pull off another Drizzt Do'Urden book without Drizzt? Without a doubt. Anybody who wasn't won over by the Wulfgar-centric <i>Spine of the World</i> should come away more than satisfied with <i>The Servant of the Shard</i>. Grumbling and hammer-hurling (courtesy of Wulfgar) might not be your thing, but Drizzt does have an equal in Entreri when it comes to perplexed introspection and predictably dazzling swordplay. If nothing else, Salvatore is merely collecting on investments he's made in his previous 17 Forgotten Realms novels--after laying such a strong foundation with solid plots and characterizations, it should come as no surprise that we're instantly sucked into a story that brings a couple of formerly supporting characters to front stage center. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>R.A.

Little Joshua Barker is in desperate need of a holiday miracle. No, he's not on his deathbed; no, his dog hasn't run away from home. But Josh is sure that he saw Santa take a shovel to the head, and now the seven-year-old has only one prayer: Please, Santa, come back from the dead.</p><p>But hold on! There's an angel waiting in the wings. (Wings, get it?) It's none other than the Archangel Raziel come to Earth seeking a small child with a wish that needs granting. Unfortunately, our angel's not sporting the brightest halo in the bunch, and before you can say "Kris Kringle," he's botched his sacred mission and sent the residents of Pine Cove headlong into Christmas chaos, culminating in the most hilarious and horrifying holiday party the town has ever seen.</p><p>Move over, Charles Dickens -- it's Christopher Moore time.</p></p><p><p>Christopher Moore is the author of the novels <em>Secondhand Souls, Sacr� Bleu, A Dirty Job,</em> and <em>Lamb.</em> He lives in San Francisco, California.</p>Tony Roberts throws himself into the "spirit of the season" with relish and pizzazz as he reads Moore's absurd story about the residents of Pine Cove, California. Roberts is dripping with enthusiasm--and his voice is rich with the ironic humor Moore uses so generously--in telling the story of a dead Santa, a foolish archangel, a stoned cop and his crazy wife, a child's wish, and a town full of zombies. Roberts's careful rendering of each character hits the mark, bringing each person--living or dead--to life. A great match for Moore's dry wit and outlandish understatement, Roberts possesses a gift for the timing needed to pull off this wildly funny tale.

What would it take to change the lives of poor children&#x2014;not one by one, through heroic interventions and occasional miracles, but in big numbers, and in a way that could be replicated nationwide? The question led him to create the Harlem Children&#x2019;s Zone, a ninety-seven-block laboratory in central Harlem where he is testing new and sometimes controversial ideas about poverty in America. His conclusion: if you want poor kids to be able to compete with their middle-class peers, you need to change everything in their lives&#x2014;their schools, their neighborhoods, even the child-rearing practices of their parents.<br><br>Whatever It Takes is a tour de force of reporting, an inspired portrait not only of Geoffrey Canada but also of the parents and children in Harlem who are struggling to better their lives, often against great odds. Carefully researched and deeply affecting, this is a dispatch from inside the most daring and potentially transformative social experiment of our time.</p><p><p>PAUL TOUGH is the author of&nbsp;<i>Helping Children Succeed&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>How Children Succeed</i>, which spent more than a year on the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;hardcover and paperback bestseller lists and was translated into twenty-eight&nbsp;languages.

He had expected a modest turnout he figured the rain would keep a lot of parents away but by 6:00 p.m. more than two hundred people had crowded into the back of the hall, and there were dozens more still streaming in the front door. Here and there, members of Canada&#x2019;s staff were consulting clipboards and calming anxious parents. His director of education hurried past him, shouting into her cell phone. It was April 14, 2004, a cool, wet night in Harlem. The hand-lettered sign out front of PS 242, streaked with raindrops, said "Welcome to the Promise Academy Charter School Lottery," and inside, past the sign-in table set up in the school&#x2019;s front hallway, a tall, bull-chested young man named Jeff was handing a rose to each woman as she walked in. "These are for the moms," he said with a smile. "Welcome to the ceremony."<p></p>Canada, a tall, thin black man in a dark blue suit, surveyed the crowd. From what he could see, the parents taking their seats in the auditorium were the ones he had hoped to attract: typical Harlem residents, mostly African American, some Hispanic, almost all poor or working class, all struggling to one degree or another with the challenges of raising and educating children in one of New York City&#x2019;s most impoverished neighborhoods. In many ways, their sons and daughters were growing up the way Canada had, four decades before, just a few miles away in the South Bronx: cut off from the American mainstream, their futures constrained by substandard schools, unstable families, and a segregated city.<p></p>Five years earlier, frustrated by Harlem&#x2019;s seemingly intractable problems, Canada had embarked on an outsized and audacious new endeavor, a poverty-fighting project that was different from anything that had come before it. Since 1990, he had been the president of a well-respected local non profit organization called the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, which operated a handful of programs in upper Manhattan targeted at young people: afterschool drop-in centers, truancy prevention, antiviolence training for teenagers. They were decent programs, and they all did some good for the kids who were enrolled in them. But after Canada had been running them for a few years, day in and day out, his ideas about poverty started to change.<p></p>The catalyst was surprisingly simple: a waiting list. One Rheedlen afterschool program had more children who wanted to enroll than it was able to admit. So Canada chose the obvious remedy: he drew up a waiting list, and it quickly filled with the names of children who needed his help and couldn&#x2019;t get it. That bothered him, and it kept bothering him, and before long it had him thinking differently about his entire organization. Sure, the five hundred children who were lucky enough to be participating in one of his programs were getting help, but why those five hundred and not the five hundred on the waiting list? Or why not another five hundred altogether? For that matter, why five hundred and not five thousand? If all he was doing was picking some kids to save and letting the rest fail, what was the point?<p></p>Canada became less and less sure of what his programs really added up to. Each one was supported by a separate short-term grant, often on a contract from one city agency or another, and in order to keep the money fl owing, Canada was required to demonstrate to the foundations and agencies that paid for the programs that a certain number of children had par tic i pated. But no one seemed to care whether the programs were ac tually working. In fact, no one seemed to have given a whole lot of thought to what, in this context, "working" might really mean.<p></p>Canada began to wonder what would happen if he reversed the equation. Instead of coming up with a menu of well-meaning programs and then trying to figure out what they accomplished and how they fit together, what if he started with the out comes he wanted to achieve and then worked backward from there, changing and tweaking and overhauling programs until they actually produced the right results? When he followed this train of thought a little further, he realized that it wasn&#x2019;t the out comes of individual programs that he really cared about: what mattered was the overall impact he was able to have on the children he was trying to serve. He was all too familiar with the "fade-out" phenomenon, where a group of needy kids are helped along by one program or another, only to return to the disappointing mean soon after the program ends. Head Start, the government-funded prekindergarten program for poor children, was the classic example. Plenty of studies had determined conclusively that graduates of Head Start entered kindergarten ahead of their inner-city peers. And plenty of studies had shown that a few years later, those same graduates had slipped back to the anemic achievement level of neighborhood kids who hadn&#x2019;t attended Head Start. A few years of bad schooling and bad surroundings were powerful enough to wipe out all of the program&#x2019;s gains.<p></p>Canada wanted to find a way off the treadmill. So he asked himself a series of questions, and gradually his thinking took shape.<p></p></p><h2>Hardware: The Definitive SF Works of Chris Foss</h2><p>Foss&#x2019;s groundbreaking and distinctive science fiction art revolutionized paperback covers in the 1970s and 80s. &nbsp;Dramatically raising the bar for realism and invention, his trademark battle-weary spacecraft, dramatic alien landscapes and crumbling brutalist architecture irrevocably changed the aesthetic of science fiction art and cinema. <br><br>Featuring work for books by Isaac Asimov, E.

To be like Christ, Sheen emphasizes that the priest must imitate Christ in His example of sacrifice, offering himself as a victim to make His Incarnation continually present in the world.</p><p>"Unlike anyone else, Our Lord came on earth, not to live, but to die. Death for our redemption was the goal of His sojourn here, the gold that he was seeking. He was, therefore, not primarily a teacher, but a Savior. Was not Christ the Priest a Victim? He never offered anything except Himself. So we have a mutilated concept of our priesthood, if we envisage it apart from making ourselves victims in the prolongation of His Incarnation."<br><b>&#x2015;Bishop Fulton Sheen</b></p></p><p><b>Archbishop Fulton Sheen</b>&nbsp;was one of the most celebrated churchmen of the twentieth century.

In just over one hundred pages, Ralph W. Tyler presented the concept that curriculum should be dynamic, a program under constant evaluation and revision. Curriculum had always been thought of as a static, set program, and in an era preoccupied with student testing, he offered the innovative idea that teachers and administrators should spend as much time evaluating their plans as they do assessing their students.<br> <br> Since then, <i>Basic Principles of Curriculum and Instruction</i> has been a standard reference for anyone working with curriculum development. Although not a strict how-to guide, the book shows how educators can critically approach curriculum planning, studying progress and retooling when needed. Its four sections focus on setting objectives, selecting learning experiences, organizing instruction, and evaluating progress. Readers will come away with a firm understanding of how to formulate educational objectives and how to analyze and adjust their plans so that students meet the objectives. Tyler also explains that curriculum planning is a continuous, cyclical process, an instrument of education that needs to be fine-tuned.</p> <br> This emphasis on thoughtful evaluation has kept <i>Basic Principles of Curriculum and Instruction</i> a relevant, trusted companion for over sixty years. And with school districts across the nation working feverishly to align their curriculum with Common Core standards, Tyler's straightforward recommendations are sound and effective tools for educators working to create a curriculum that integrates national objectives with their students' needs.</p><p><b>Ralph W. Tyler</b> (1902&#x2013;94) was an American educator who worked in the field of assessment and evaluation. He served on or advised a number of bodies that set guidelines for the expenditure of&nbsp;federal&nbsp;funds and influenced the underlying policy of&nbsp;the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.&nbsp;Tyler chaired the committee that eventually developed the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). He was professor of education and dean of the Division of Social Sciences at the University of Chicago."Tyler addresses the essential purposes of teaching in a way that still has relevance for contemporary students of education, and communicates to them how important and timeless the quality of the pupil-teacher interaction actually is."

He&#x2019;s taught throughout North America, Middle East, Asia, Europe, Africa, and Australia; worked with the City of Tucson and other municipalities to legalize, incentivize, and provide guidance on water-harvesting systems, demonstration sites, and policy; and designed edible rain-irrigated landscapes doubling as flood control and community-building strategies for housing developments, parks, schools, businesses, ranches, and neighborhoods. Brad&#x2019;s aim is always to boost communities&#x2019; true health and wealth by using simple overlapping strategies to augment the region&#x2019;s hydrology, ecosystems, and economies&#x2015;living systems upon which we depend.</p> <p>Brad lives his talk on an oasis-like demonstration site he created with his brother&#x2019;s family in downtown Tucson, Arizona. On this eighth of an acre and surrounding public right-of-way, they harvest 100,000 gallons of rainwater a year where just 11 inches per year fall from the sky. Brad is motivated in his work by the tens of thousands of people he has helped inspire to do likewise, go further, and continue our collective evolution.</p><br><br>Andy Lipkis is the founder and president of TreePeople.<p>&#x201c;Harvesting rainwater was once a worldwide technology, but was replaced by pipes, canals, and sprinklers: an inefficient and wasteful strategy that results in running dry. In <em>Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond, Volume 2</em> Brad uses the concept of &#x2018;planting water&#x2019; as a guiding principle in designing landscapes that passively harvest resources to grow more resources. Such brilliant, low-tech, regenerative systems are vital to hydrating the land and maximizing the benefit that water brings to plants, animals and people. Thus, this book is an excellent and comprehensive tool for all bucket and shovel &#x2018;engineers&#x2019; to maximize the hydrological resource, reduce energy use and transform their once erosive landscapes into ones of stability, botanical diversity, and abundance.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Arty Mangan, Bioneers Food and Farming Program Director</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;The original edition was a great book, and this edition is even better!

He has produced a water-farming guide that will inspire both the casual gardener and the card-carrying permaculturalist. With step-by-step instructions and clear illustrations, he guides the reader through simple techniques -berms, curbcuts, greywater plumbing &#x2013; which in turn guide water into your soil and landscape.

This is the gospel, or so we are taught. But what is faith? And does this accurately summarize the gospel? Because faith is frequently misunderstood and the climax of the gospel misidentified, the gospel's full power remains untapped. While offering a fresh proposal for what faith means within a biblical theology of salvation, Matthew Bates presses the church toward a new precision: we are saved solely by allegiance to Jesus the king. Instead of faith alone, Christians must speak about salvation by allegiance alone. The book includes discussion questions for students, pastors, and church groups and a foreword by Scot McKnight.</p><p><b><i>Jesus Creed</i></b><b> 2017 Book of the Year</b><br><br>"In this well-argued book, Matthew Bates recovers a deeper sense of what the act of faith consists of as it is depicted in Scripture.&nbsp;He wisely observes that the story of the rich young ruler in the Synoptic Gospels presumes that salvation depends on certain human actions.&nbsp;How those actions are related to salvation by faith alone is a central question raised by this book and elegantly answered."<br>--<b>Gary Anderson</b>, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"In this bold, provocative book, Matthew Bates challenges Christians of all traditions to reexamine basic assumptions about the gospel, grace, the nature of salvation, and the meaning of 'faith.' His argument for saving faith as embodied, enacted allegiance is rooted in solid scholarship and presented with both zeal for the kingdom and concern for the church. This is a much-needed corrective to many misunderstandings."<br>--<b>Michael&nbsp;J. Gorman</b>, St. Mary's Seminary and University<br><br>"Matthew Bates argues that faith or believing is not mere assent, not easy believism, but covenantal loyalty to the God who saves his people through the Lord Jesus Christ. Bates forces us to rethink the meaning of faith, the gospel, and works with a view to demonstrating their significance for true Christian discipleship. This will be a controversial book, but perhaps it is the controversy we need!"<br>--<b>Michael&nbsp;F. Bird</b>, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia<br><br>"Bates makes a powerful argument that the New Testament writings find their climax in their portrait of Christ as the enthroned king. The right response to this king is not simply trust or intellectual assent but rather wholehearted allegiance. Bates's reframing of faith, works, and the gospel is a necessary correction to prevalent distortions of Jesus's gospel. This is an important argument written by a creative, careful, and trustworthy biblical interpreter."<br>--<b>Joshua Jipp</b>, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>"[An] outstanding book. . . . The superficiality of American evangelicalism's gospel-obsession with security and assurance has led me at times to wonder if we should not teach justification by <i>discipleship</i>. Or justification by <i>faithfulness</i>. But Matthew Bates has landed on a beautiful and biblically sound term: <i>allegiance</i>."<br>--<b>Scot McKnight</b>, Northern Seminary (from the foreword)<b>Matthew W.

One claims to be the Black&#x2019;s rightful owner and one is trying to kill the beautiful steed. An Arab chieftain proves his ownership of the Black and takes him away, but Alec is determined to find his horse again. Following the pair to Arabia, Alec encounters great evil and intrigue, as only a horse as spectacular as the Black could inspire.</p><p><b>Walter Farley</b>'s first book,&nbsp;<i>The Black Stallion</i>, was an instant hit when it appeared in 1941. Mr. Farley went on to write thirty-three other enormously popular books about the Black Stallion and other horses which were published in more than twenty countries. He died in 1989, shortly before the publication of his last novel,&nbsp;<i>The Young Black Stallion</i>, written with his son Steven.Night hung black and heavy about the old barn. An iron gate creaked a short distance away and a few minutes later the short figure of a man slid alongside the barn. As he moved cautiously forward his fat, gloved hand felt the wood. The man stopped as he neared the door and his hand dug into his right coat pocket. Fumbling, he searched for something. Not finding it, he uttered an oath and reached awkwardly across to his left-hand pocket. He pulled the empty sleeve from the pocket and reached inside, withdrawing a long hypodermic needle. His dark-skinned face creased into folds of fatty tissue as he smiled. Moving forward once again, he did not bother to replace the empty coat sleeve and it hung limply at his side in the still air.<br><br> The prowler reached the door. Carefully he opened it and slid inside. His eyes, already accustomed to the darkness, made out the stalls on the other side of the barn. As he moved toward them, his thumb slipped to the back of the hypodermic needle.<br><br> The hard ring of a horse's hoofs against the floor came from one of the stalls. Then a long and slender neck that arched to a small, savagely beautiful head peered over the door. Thin-skinned nostrils quivered as black ears pitched forward. The prowler, halfway to the stall door, had stopped. The horse shook his long black mane and a powerful foreleg struck the door.<br><br> A board creaked as the man moved closer. Baring his teeth, the horse whistled the shrill, loud scream of a wild stallion. As the whistle resounded through the barn, the prowler moved forward. He would have to work fast. Mincing steps carried his round body to the stall door with amazing speed. He opened it, but fell back as the black stallion struck at him.<br><br> Gripping the hypodermic firmly, the prowler advanced again, more cautiously this time. He stopped and his fat face twitched nervously. The giant horse rose on his hind legs, mouth open and teeth bared. As he came down, the man lunged at him, but the horse's foreleg caught him in the groin. The attacker turned gray beneath his bronze skin. Staggering back, he attempted to close the stall door behind him. The stallion, halfway through the door, rose again on his hind legs as the man stumbled and fell to the floor. Thrashing hoofs pawed the air above him. The hypodermic dropped from his hand as the giant form began to descend. The man rolled fast, avoiding the stallion's hoofs by inches. Climbing to his feet, he ran frantically for the barn door.<br><br> Outside, he heard voices coming from the direction of the gate and, turning, stumbled off into the night, the empty coat sleeve waving slightly at his side.<br><br> A few minutes later a young boy, carrying a flashlight, ran up to the barn door. Following him was a bowlegged man who moved with jerky strides.<br><br> "Something must be wrong, Henry," the youth shouted. "The door's open!"<br><br> Henry grabbed the flashlight. "Yeah, I'll go in, Alec. Y'stay here, just in case . . ."<br><br> Impatiently, Alec waited while Henry entered the barn. A hand swept nervously across his pug nose as he pinched his nostrils. There was a worried expression on his freckled face. If anything had happened to the Black! Then he heard the short neigh and the sound of the stallion's hoofs against the floor. His tense body relaxed. Everything was probably all right. Looking around the yard, his gaze swept to the open field. It was getting light and already he could make out the high white fence at the north end. There was no one around. He tightened the belt holding up his corduroys and then pushed a hand through his red, tousled hair.<br><br> Turning on the lights, Henry appeared in the doorway. He beckoned Alec inside.<br><br> The Black was in his stall. He whistled softly when he saw Alec and shook his black mane, which mounted high, then fell low, like a crest.<br><br> "Find anything, Henry?"<br><br> "He was out of his stall. Someone's been here . . . there's been a fight of some kind. He's sweated." Henry ran a gnarled hand over the stallion's body as it glistened in the bright light.<br><br> The Black moved nervously around his stall and didn't quiet until Alec's hand rested on the thin-skinned nostrils. "He seems to be okay though, Henry."<br><br> "Yep." Henry was quiet. In his hand he studied a long glass object wrapped in his handkerchief.<br><br> "What is it?" Alec asked.<br><br> "A hypo."<br><br> "You mean a hypodermic needle?" Alec asked incredulously. "You found it here?"<br><br> "Yep . . . on the floor."<br><br> "What's it mean, Henry?" Alec moved away from the Black to get a closer view of the glass tube.<br><br> "Looks as if someone intended to use it on the Black."<br><br> "Y'mean . . ." Alec's heart thumped hard. "Henry, are you sure it hasn't been used?"<br><br> "It's filled. We'll get the stuff analyzed today by the police and find out what it is. Maybe it'll give us a clue of some kind." He wrapped the needle in the handkerchief and said, "Also, there might be some fingerprints. . . ."<br><br> Alec moved over to the Black again. The stallion lowered his head and, rubbing it, Alec asked, "But why would anyone want to harm him, Henry?"<br><br> "Your guess is as good as mine, Alec." Then Henry added, ". . . perhaps better."<br><br> "What do you mean?"<br><br> Henry moved over to Alec and placed a long arm on the stall door. "Well, here's how I figure it out. The Black is a valuable horse since he beat out Sun Raider and Cyclone last June. There's no doubt that he's the fastest thing to set foot on any track here or abroad. Now to my way of thinkin' there's a good many reasons why somebody would want to steal the Black. He couldn't be raced but he could be used for stud . . . that horse could do much to improve the bloodline of the American thoroughbred. . . ."</p><h2>Life on the Other Side: A Psychic&#39;s Tour of the Afterlife</h2><p>Take a journey you will never forget<b>&#x2014;</b>and discover the answer to life&#x2019;s greatest question:<p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s on The Other Side?&#x201d;</p><p>Renowned psychic, spiritual teacher, and #1 New York Times bestselling author Sylvia Browne has changed millions of lives with her unique gifts.

Readers should be warned that it takes a huge leap of faith to follow this celebrity psychic across the chasm of doubt to the other side. In her opening chapters she explains that she is like the young boy in the movie <i>The Sixth Sense</i>--she sees dead people. When she was a child, these spirits came into her room at night and disappeared when a light went on. "To this day I can't sleep in a completely dark room, because the minute I try it the room starts filling up," she writes. "As a child, it was scary. As an adult, it's just annoying..." <p> Once she establishes her lengthy connections to life after death (including conversations with a spirit guide named Francine and her own near-death experience), Browne launches into life in the fourth dimension. In a chapter titled "After the Tunnel, Arriving on the Other Side," Browne explains that newcomers pass through a "hall of wisdom" and then review their most recent life through a "scanning machine." In the chapter "Beyond the Entrance," Brown claims that spirits live in whatever kind of home they've longed for, or they recreate a favorite home from earth. Plus, "the more spiritually advanced we become, the more physical beauty we're given, as a badge of our progress and hard work." Sex is known as "merging" and does not require birth control or any commitments of exclusivity. These kinds of glowing accounts of the other side cause skeptics to snicker, believers to feel comforted, and thousands of fans to keep on buying her books. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><b>Sylvia Browne</b>&nbsp;was a psychic and the #1 <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of <i>End of Days</i>,&nbsp;<i>Blessings from the Other Side</i>, <i>Adventures of a Psychic,</i>&nbsp;<i>The Other Side&nbsp;and Back</i>,&nbsp;and <i>Life on the Other Side</i>.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Lindsay Harrison</b>&nbsp;is a writer and teacher living in New York City.</p><h2>The Message of the Psalms (Augsburg Old Testament Studies)</h2><p>Dr. Brueggemann describes the human cries of anguish and the exultations of praise expressed in the Psalms.</p><p><p><b>Walter Brueggemann</b> is William Marcellus McPheeters Professor of Old Testament Emeritus at Columbia Theological Seminary and the author of numerous books including, from Fortress Press, <i>The Prophetic Imagination</i>,<i>Theology of the Old Testament</i> and <i>The Creative Word</i>.</p></p><h2>Trees: Revised and Updated (A Golden Guide from St. Martin&#39;s Press)</h2><p><p>This Golden Guide describes and illustrates in full color more than 140 of our most common trees.

In nearly every moment of our waking lives, we face a barrage of efforts to harvest our attention. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This condition is not simply the byproduct of recent technological innovations but the result of more than a century's growth and expansion in the industries that feed on human attention. Wu&#x2019;s narrative begins in the nineteenth century, when Benjamin Day discovered he could get rich selling newspapers for a penny. Since then, every new medium&#x2014;from radio to television to Internet companies such as Google and Facebook&#x2014;has attained commercial viability and immense riches by turning itself into an advertising platform. Since the early days, the basic business model of &#x201c;attention merchants&#x201d; has never changed: free diversion in exchange for a moment of your time, sold in turn to the highest-bidding advertiser. Full of lively, unexpected storytelling and piercing insight, <i>The Attention Merchants </i>lays bare the true nature of a ubiquitous reality we can no longer afford to accept at face value.</p><p><b>Tim Wu</b> is a policy advocate and professor at Columbia Law School.

The jamb always swelled in the fall and you really had to give the door a yank to shut it. This time they had forgotten. She thought of telling Gerald to go back and shut the door before they got too involved or that banging would drive her nuts. Then she thought how ridiculous that would be, given the current circumstances. It would ruin the whole mood.<br> <br>What mood?<br> <br>A good question, that. And as Gerald turned the hollow barrel of the key in the second lock, as she heard the minute click from above her left ear, she realized that, for her at least, the mood wasn&#x2019;t worth preserving. That was why she had noted the unlatched door in the first place, of course. For her, the sexual turn-on of the bondage games hadn&#x2019;t lasted long.<br> <br>The same could not be said of Gerald, however. He was wearing only a pair of Jockey shorts now, and she didn&#x2019;t have to look as high as his face to see that his interest continued unabated.<br> <br>This is stupid, she thought, but stupid wasn&#x2019;t the whole story, either. It was also a little scary. She didn&#x2019;t like to admit it, but there it was.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gerald, why don&#x2019;t we just forget this?&#x201d;<br> <br>He hesitated for a moment, frowning a little, then went on across the room to the dresser which stood to the left of the bathroom door. His face cleared as he went. She watched him from where she lay on the bed, her arms raised and splayed out, making her look a little like Fay Wray chained up and waiting for the great ape in King Kong. Her wrists had been secured to the mahogany bedposts with two sets of handcuffs. The chains gave each hand about six inches&#x2019; worth of movement. Not much.<br> <br>He put the keys on top of the dresser&#x2014;two minute clicks, her ears seemed in exceptionally fine working order for a Wednesday afternoon&#x2014;and then turned back to her. Over his head, sunripples from the lake danced and wavered on the bedroom&#x2019;s high white ceiling.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you say? This has lost a lot of its charm for me.&#x201d; And it never had that much to begin with, she did not add.<br> <br>He grinned. He had a heavy, pink-skinned face below a narrow widow&#x2019;s peak of hair as black as a crow&#x2019;s wing, and that grin of his had always done something to her that she didn&#x2019;t much care for. She couldn&#x2019;t quite put her finger on what that something was, but&#x2014;<br> <br>Oh, sure you can. It makes him look stupid. You can practically see his IQ going down ten points for every inch that grin spreads. At its maximum width, your killer corporate lawyer of a husband looks like a janitor on work-release from the local mental institution.<br> <br>That was cruel, but not entirely inaccurate. But how did you tell your husband of almost twenty years that every time he grinned he looked as if he were suffering from light mental retardation? The answer was simple, of course: you didn&#x2019;t. His smile was a different matter entirely. He had a lovely smile&#x2014;she guessed it was that smile, so warm and good-humored, which had persuaded her to go out with him in the first place. It had reminded her of her father&#x2019;s smile when he told his family amusing things about his day as he sipped a before-dinner gin and tonic.<br> <br>This wasn&#x2019;t the smile, though. This was the grin&#x2014;a version of it he seemed to save just for these sessions. She had an idea that to Gerald, who was on the inside of it, the grin felt wolfish. Piratical, maybe. From her angle, however, lying here with her arms raised above her head and nothing on but a pair of bikini panties, it only looked stupid. No . . . retarded. He was, after all, no devil-may-care adventurer like the ones in the men&#x2019;s magazines over which he had spent the furious ejaculations of his lonely, overweight puberty; he was an attorney with a pink, too-large face spreading below a widow&#x2019;s peak which was narrowing relentlessly toward total baldness. Just an attorney with a hard-on poking the front of his undershorts out of shape. And only moderately out of shape, at that.<br> <br>The size of his erection wasn&#x2019;t the important thing, though. The important thing was the grin. It hadn&#x2019;t changed a bit, and that meant Gerald hadn&#x2019;t taken her seriously. She was supposed to protest; after all, that was the game.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gerald? I mean it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The grin widened. A few more of his small, inoffensive attorney&#x2019;s teeth came into view; his IQ tumbled another twenty or thirty points. And he still wasn&#x2019;t hearing her.<br> <br>Are you sure of that?<br> <br>She was. She couldn&#x2019;t read him like a book&#x2014;she supposed it took a lot more than seventeen years of marriage to get to that point&#x2014;but she thought she usually had a pretty good idea of what was going through his head. She thought something would be seriously out of whack if she didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>If that&#x2019;s the truth, toots, how come he can&#x2019;t read you? How come he can&#x2019;t see this isn&#x2019;t just a new scene in the same old sex-farce?<br> <br>Now it was her turn to frown slightly. She had always heard voices inside her head&#x2014;she guessed everyone did, although people usually didn&#x2019;t talk about them, any more than they talked about their bowel functions&#x2014;and most of them were old friends, as comfortable as bedroom slippers. This one, however, was new . . . and there was nothing comfortable about it. It was a strong voice, one that sounded young and vigorous. It also sounded impatient. Now it spoke again, answering its own question.<br> <br>It isn&#x2019;t that he can&#x2019;t read you; it&#x2019;s just that sometimes, toots, he doesn&#x2019;t want to.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gerald, really&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t feel like it. Bring the keys back and unlock me. We&#x2019;ll do something else. I&#x2019;ll get on top, if you want. Or you can just lie there with your hands behind your head and I&#x2019;ll do you, you know, the other way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Are you sure you want to do that? the new voice asked. Are you really sure you want to have any sex with this man?<br> <br>Jessie closed her eyes, as if she could make the voice shut up by doing that. When she opened them again, Gerald was standing at the foot of the bed, the front of his shorts jutting like the prow of a ship. Well . . . some kid&#x2019;s toy boat, maybe. His grin had widened further, exposing the last few teeth&#x2014;the ones with the gold fillings&#x2014;on both sides. She didn&#x2019;t just dislike that dumb grin, she realized; she despised it.<br> <br>&#x201c;I will let you up . . . if you&#x2019;re very, very good. Can you be very, very good, Jessie?&#x201d;<br> <br>Corny, the new no-bullshit voice commented. Tr�s corny.<br> <br>He hooked his thumbs into the waistband of his underpants like some absurd gunslinger. The Jockeys went down pretty fast once they got past his not inconsiderable love handles. And there it was, exposed. Not the formidable engine of love she had first encountered as a teenager in the pages of Fanny Hill but something meek and pink and circumcised; five inches of completely unremarkable erection. Two or three years ago, on one of her infrequent trips to Boston, she had seen a movie called The Belly of an Architect. She thought, Right. And now I&#x2019;m looking at The Penis of an Attorney. She had to bite the insides of her cheeks to keep from laughing. Laughing at this point would be impolitic.<br> <br>An idea came to her then, and it killed any urge she&#x2019;d had to laugh. It was this: he didn&#x2019;t know she was serious because for him, Jessie Mahout Burlingame, wife of Gerald, sister of Maddy and Will, daughter of Tom and Sally, mother of no one, was really not here at all. She had ceased to be here when the keys made their small, steely clicks in the locks of the handcuffs. The men&#x2019;s adventure magazines of Gerald&#x2019;s teenage years had been replaced by a pile of skin magazines in the bottom drawer of his desk, magazines in which women wearing pearls and nothing else knelt on bearskin rugs while men with sexual equipment that made Gerald&#x2019;s look strictly HO-scale by comparison took them from behind. In the backs of these magazines, between the talk-dirty-to-me phone ads with their 900 numbers, were ads for inflatable women which were supposed to be anatomically correct&#x2014;a bizarre concept if Jessie had ever encountered one. She thought of those air-filled dollies now, their pink skins, lineless cartoon bodies, and featureless faces, with a kind of revelatory amazement. It wasn&#x2019;t horror&#x2014;not quite&#x2014;but an intense light flashed on inside her, and the landscape it disclosed was certainly more frightening than this stupid game, or the fact that this time they were playing it in the summer house by the lake long after summer had run away for another year.<br> <br>But none of it had affected her hearing in the slightest. Now it was a chainsaw she heard, snarling away in the woods at some considerable distance&#x2014;as much as five miles, maybe. Closer by, out on the main body of Kashwakamak Lake, a loon tardy in starting its annual run south lifted its crazed cry into the blue October air. Closer still, somewhere here on the north shore, a dog barked. It was an ugly, ratcheting sound, but Jessie found it oddly comforting. It meant that someone else was up here, midweek in October or no. Otherwise there was just the sound of the door, loose as an old tooth in a rotted gum, slapping at the swollen jamb. She felt that if she had to listen to that for long, it would drive her crazy.<br> <br>Gerald, now naked save for his spectacles, knelt on the bed and began crawling up toward her. His eyes were still gleaming.<br> <br>She had an idea it was that gleam which had kept her playing the game long after her initial curiosity had been satisfied. It had been years since she&#x2019;d seen that much heat in Gerald&#x2019;s gaze when he looked at her. She wasn&#x2019;t bad-looking&#x2014;she&#x2019;d managed to keep the weight off, and still had most of her figure&#x2014;but Gerald&#x2019;s interest in her had waned just the same. She had an idea that the booze was partly to blame for that&#x2014;he drank a hell of a lot more now than when they&#x2019;d first been married&#x2014;but she knew the booze wasn&#x2019;t all of it. What was the old saw about familiarity breeding contempt? That wasn&#x2019;t supposed to hold true for men and women in love, at least according to the Romantic poets she&#x2019;d read in English Lit 101, but in the years since college she had discovered there were certain facts of life about which John Keats and Percy Shelley had never written. But of course, they had both died a lot younger than she and Gerald were now.<br> <br>And all of that didn&#x2019;t matter much right here and right now. What maybe did was that she had gone on with the game longer than she had really wanted to because she had liked that hot little gleam in Gerald&#x2019;s eyes. It made her feel young and pretty and desirable. But . . .<br> <br>. . . but if you really thought it was you he was seeing when he got that look in his eye, you were misled, toots. Or maybe you misled yourself. And maybe now you have to decide&#x2014;really, really decide&#x2014;if you intend to continue putting up with this humiliation. Because isn&#x2019;t that pretty much how you feel? Humiliated?<br> <br>She sighed. Yes. It pretty much was.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gerald, I do mean it.&#x201d; She spoke louder now, and for the first time the gleam in his eyes flickered a little. Good. He could hear her after all, it seemed. So maybe things were still okay. Not great, it had been a long time since things had been what you could call great, but okay. Then the gleam reappeared, and a moment later the idiot grin followed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll teach you, me proud beauty,&#x201d; he said. He actually said that, pronouncing beauty the way the landlord in a bad Victorian melodrama might say it.<br> <br>Let him do it, then. Just let him do it and it will be done.<br> <br>This was a voice she was much more familiar with, and she intended to follow its advice. She didn&#x2019;t know if Gloria Steinem would approve and didn&#x2019;t care; the advice had the attractiveness of the completely practical. Let him do it and it would be done. Q.E.D.<br> <br>Then his hand&#x2014;his soft, short-fingered hand, its flesh as pink as that which capped his penis&#x2014;reached out and grasped her breast, and something inside her suddenly popped like an overstrained tendon. She bucked her hips and back sharply upward, flinging his hand off.<br> <br>&#x201c;Quit it, Gerald. Unlock these stupid handcuffs and let me up. This stopped being fun around last March, while there was still snow on the ground. I don&#x2019;t feel sexy; I feel ridiculous.&#x201d;<br> <br>This time he heard her all the way down. She could see it in the way the gleam in his eyes went out all at once, like candleflames in a strong gust of wind. She guessed that the two words which had finally gotten through to him were stupid and ridiculous. He had been a fat kid with thick glasses, a kid who hadn&#x2019;t had a date until he was eighteen&#x2014;the year after he went on a strict diet and began to work out in an effort to strangle the engirdling flab before it could strangle him. By the time he was a sophomore in college, Gerald&#x2019;s life was what he described as &#x201c;more or less under control&#x201d; (as if life&#x2014;his life, anyway&#x2014;were a bucking bronco he had been ordered to tame), but she knew his high school years had been a horror show that had left him with a deep legacy of contempt for himself and suspicion of others.<br> <br>His success as a corporate lawyer (and marriage to her; she believed that had also played a part, perhaps even the crucial one) had further restored his confidence and self-respect, but she supposed that some nightmares never completely ended. In a deep part of his mind, the bullies were still giving Gerald wedgies in study-hall, still laughing at Gerald&#x2019;s inability to do anything but girlie-pushups in phys ed, and there were words&#x2014;stupid and ridiculous, for instance&#x2014;that brought all that back as if high school had been yesterday . . . or so she suspected. Psychologists could be incredibly stupid about many things, almost willfully stupid, it often seemed to her, but about the horrible persistence of some memories she thought they were bang-on. Some memories battened onto a person&#x2019;s mind like evil leeches, and certain words&#x2014;stupid and ridiculous, for example&#x2014;could bring them instantly back to squirming, feverish life.<br> <br>She waited to feel a pang of shame at hitting below the belt like this and was pleased&#x2014;or maybe it was relief she felt&#x2014;when no pang came. I guess maybe I&#x2019;m just tired of pretending, she thought, and this idea led to another: she might have her own sexual agenda, and if she did, this business with the handcuffs was definitely not on it. They made her feel demeaned. The whole idea made her feel demeaned. Oh, a certain uneasy excitement had accompanied the first few experiments&#x2014;the ones with the scarves&#x2014;and on a couple of occasions she&#x2019;d had multiple orgasms, and that was a rarity for her. All the same, there had been side-effects she didn&#x2019;t care for, and that feeling of being somehow demeaned was only one of them. She&#x2019;d had her own nightmares following each of those early versions of Gerald&#x2019;s game. She awoke from them sweaty and gasping, her hands thrust deeply into the fork of her crotch and rolled into tight little balls. She only remembered one of these dreams, and that memory was distant, blurred: she had been playing croquet without any clothes on, and all at once the sun had gone out.<br> <br>Never mind all that, Jessie; those are things you can consider another day. Right now the only important thing is getting him to let you loose.<br> <br>Yes. Because this wasn&#x2019;t their game; this game was all his. She had gone on playing it simply because Gerald wanted her to. And that was no longer good enough.<br> <br>The loon voiced its lonely cry out on the lake again. Gerald&#x2019;s dopey grin of anticipation had been replaced by a look of sulky displeasure. You broke my toy, you bitch, that look said.<br> <br>Jessie found herself remembering t...</p><h2>Chance or the Dance?: A Critique of Modern Secularism</h2><p><p>In this new edition of a modern classic, Thomas Howard contrasts the Christian and secular worldviews, refreshing our minds with the illuminated view of Christianity as it imbued the world in times past--showing that we cannot live meaningful lives without this Christian understanding of things. This is an inspiring apology for Christianity, and a stirring critique of secularism.</p><p>Howard explains in clear and beautiful language why secular humanism is robbing us of the beauty, depth and profound truths of Christianity. With laser precision through lyrical ponderings he takes us through the dismal reductionist view of the world to the shimmering significance of this world as sign and sacrament. A book that is more timely now than when it was first written, and a prophetic examination of modern society's conscience.</p></p><p><p>Thomas Howard was a highly regarded Professor of English and Literature for over 30 years. He is the popular author of numerous books including Dove Descending: T.S. Eliot's "Four Quartets", Evangelical Is Not Enough, Lead Kindly Light, Hallowed be This House and many other fine works.</p><p>"Thomas Howard lays out the fundamental question that faces us today&#x2014;whether to accept a view of the world that says we are extraordinary creatures whose lives have eternal meaning or to accept a view that says we are cosmic accidents whose lives have no meaning at all. One of the best books of the latter half of the twentieth century."<br>-- <strong>Eric Metaxas</strong>, <em>New York Times</em> Best-Selling Author, <em>Bonhoeffer</em></p> <p>"This book reveals the heart of Thomas Howard's vision and that of Christendom for nineteen centuries until the cruel restraints of modern secularism emptied the cosmos of color, heroism, and passion. If I could have everyone read just ten books, this would be one of them!" <br>-- <strong>Peter Kreeft, Ph.D.</strong>, Author, <em>I Burned for Your Peace</em></p> <p>"Imagine looking through a lens that shows the whole world in a new and brilliant light, that allows us to trace countless patterns once unseen, connect dots once unconnected, so that a universe once seemingly shattered is now seen to be marvelously woven together. <em>Chance or the Dance?&nbsp;</em>is that lens."<br> --<strong>Paul Thigpen, Ph.D.</strong>,&nbsp;Author,&nbsp;<em>Manual for Spiritual Warfare</em>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>"Here is a book to be read and reread, to be shared and discussed, so that hopefully we can be more receptive to the grace trying to lead us to the shores of the Kingdom."<br> --<strong>Marcus Grodi</strong>, EWTN Host, <em>The Journey Home</em>; Author, <em>Life from Our Land</em></p><br><br><p>"Some rare books really explain things, how they are. This book is one. Howard's poetic, reflective reminder of how we see the image of God in all things because each is made in the Word is a book that genuinely teaches and inspires." <br> --<strong>Fr.

It is also the first comprehensive documentation of BIG&#x2019;s trailblazing practice&#x2015;where method, process, instruments, and concepts are constantly questioned and redefined. Or, as the group itself says:&#x201c;Historically, architecture has been dominated by two opposing extremes: an avant-garde full of crazy ideas, originating from philosophy or mysticism; and the well organized corporate consultants that build predictable and boring boxes of high standard. Architecture seems entrenched: naively utopian or petrifyingly pragmatic. We believe there is a third way between these diametric opposites: a pragmatic utopian architecture that creates socially, economically, and environmentally perfect places as a practical objective. At BIG we are devoted to investing in the overlap between radical and reality. In all our actions we try to move the focus from the little details to the BIG picture.&#x201d;</p><p>Bjarke Ingels attracts highly talented coworkers, but also gifted and ambitious clients from all over the world.

The authors make the case that design skills such as reframing, prototyping and brainstorming can help us make better career and life choices, or undo bad choices before they do more harm.

Carmen Acevedo Butcher&#x2019;s new translation is the first to bring the text into a modern English idiom&#x2014;while remaining strictly faithful to the meaning of the original Middle English. <br> <br> <i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i> consists of a series of letters written by a monk to his student or disciple, instructing him (or her) in the way of Divine union. Its theology is presented in a way that is remarkably easy to understand, as well as practical, providing advice on prayer and contemplation that anyone can use. Previous translations of the <i>Cloud</i> have tended to veil its intimate, even friendly tone under medieval-sounding language. Carmen Butcher has boldly brought the text into language as appealing to modern ears as it was to its original readers more than five hundred years ago. <br> <br>Also included in the volume is the companion work attributed to the same anonymous author, <i>The Book of Privy Counsel</i>, which contains further advice for approaching God in a way that emphasizes real experience rather than human knowledge.</p><p>Carmen Acevedo Butcher is Associate Professor of Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Shorter College, Rome, Georgia, where she is also Scholar-in-Residence.

Horrified as he stood on a height above the Potomac, James Madison, the fourth President of the United States&#x2014;and now, some wondered, the last?&#x2014;watched his beloved Washington City as it seemed to vanish into a crimson-orange swirl of fire. It was after midnight on Wednesday, August 24, 1814, and Madison was a fugitive, escaping the Capital&#x2014;first by ferry, then by galloping horse&#x2014;for the dark wilderness of Virginia.<br><br> Still wearing formal knee breeches and buckled shoes, the sixty- three-year-old Madison knew that the invader-incendiaries from Great Britain were out for his capture and arrest, which might force him to be hanged. But he kept dismounting his horse to stare, with those intelligent blue eyes that &#x201c;sparkled like stars,&#x201d; at the inferno across the Potomac. He could not help himself. As a student of the Bible since col- lege, Madison knew that God had warned Lot&#x2019;s wife not to look back at burning Sodom or else become a pillar of salt. Nevertheless the beleaguered President&#x2014;who stood about five feet, four inches, and weighed perhaps a hundred pounds&#x2014;kept gazing at the flaming, otherworldly spectacle, the nadir of the War of 1812, which many Americans bitterly called &#x201c;Mr. Madison&#x2019;s War.&#x201d;<br><br> Earlier that day, Madison&#x2019;s popular, shrewd, vivacious wife, Dolley, had stayed behind at the Executive Mansion while James was out reviewing the forces charged with Washington&#x2019;s defense. She asked her husband&#x2019;s enslaved body servant Paul Jennings (who once lauded the President as a man who would not &#x201c;strike a slave&#x201d;) to bring out ale and cider in anticipation of a three o&#x2019;clock White House dinner they were planning for Cabinet secretaries, &#x201c;military gentlemen,&#x201d; and their wives.[1] Dolley hoped that if Washingtonians learned that the President&#x2019;s lady was keeping a normal schedule, they would feel more sanguine about the danger of the approaching British marauders. But she received a worried, scribbled plea from her nearby sister Anna: &#x201c;Tell me for gods sake where you are. . . . We can hear nothing but what is horrible here.&#x201d;<br><br> From the Mansion, Dolley peered anxiously through a spyglass with &#x201c;unwearied anxiety.&#x201d; As she wrote her other sister, Lucy, she was thinking, &#x201c;Mr. Madison comes not; may God protect him!&#x201d; Recoiling from the distant booms of British cannon, Dolley refused to flee until &#x201c;my dear husband&#x201d; was safe in her arms. But in preparation, she quickly packed letters, books, valuables, a demijohn of wine, and clothes. Determined to prevent the British from grabbing the life-sized portrait of George Washington, an irresistible battle trophy, she called out, &#x201c;Save that picture! . . . If not possible, destroy it!&#x201d; She ordered the painting removed from its gilded frame and taken by wagon to a &#x201c;humble but safe roof,&#x201d; thus ensuring her place in American history. (The Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and other treasures had already been slipped into plain linen sacks and taken to a Virginia gristmill.)<br><br> Then the Madisons&#x2019; freedman servant James Smith, waving his hat, cantered up with a message from the President: &#x201c;Clear out! General Armstrong has ordered a retreat!&#x201d;[2] Stuffing flatware into her handbag, Dolley and Sukey, her enslaved personal maid, were helped into carriages, which rushed them and their traveling companions across the Potomac to the wilds of northern Virginia, where she and James had agreed to meet. But Dolley was told that the President could not be found, and she cowered in agony and tears. Part of her fear stemmed from the fact that the British invaders were not her husband&#x2019;s only en- emies. Furious at the invasion of their Capital and, in fact, at Madison&#x2019;s whole war, some of his own countrymen had vowed to commit violence against the President if he tried to flee the city. &#x201c;I hear of much hostility towards him,&#x201d; Dolley had warned her sister Lucy. &#x201c;Disaffection stalks around us.&#x201d; One American had threatened the President with &#x201c;dagger or poison.&#x201d; According to Paul Jennings, when Dolley was desperately seeking safe haven that night in Virginia, one would-be hostess raged at her, &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s you, come down and go out! Your husband has got mine out fighting and, damn you, you shan&#x2019;t stay in my house!&#x201d;<br><br> Back across the Potomac, about 150 British soldiers&#x2014;&#x201c;the most hellish looking fellows that ever trod God&#x2019;s earth,&#x201d; recalled one bystander&#x2014; torched the Capitol of the United States. At nine o&#x2019;clock, spurred on by the British Rear Admiral George Cockburn, soon called &#x201c;the harlequin of havoc,&#x201d; with &#x201c;sun-burnt visage and his rusty gold-laced hat,&#x201d; the arsonists had laid siege to the limestone building&#x2014;two still-unconnected wings shut down in midconstruction by the war. In the chambers of the House, Senate, and Supreme Court, the enemy soldiers piled up mahogany desks, red morocco chairs, green curtains, and books. Before they lit this tinder with rocket powder, Cockburn sat in the House Speaker&#x2019;s chair and mocked the democratic pretensions of Britain&#x2019;s ex-colonies, demanding of his brother redcoats, &#x201c;Shall this harbor of Yankee &#x2018;democracy&#x2019; be burned? All for it will say, &#x2018;Aye!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> Soon the Capitol was enveloped by jagged tongues of orange flame, so searing that glass lamp shades melted. Cockburn decreed the raising of his own country&#x2019;s Union Jack, then, riding on a mule, ordered his redcoats to march double file down Pennsylvania Avenue. Demanding their silence, to avoid arousing Washingtonians to fight back, Cock- burn shouted, &#x201c;If any man speaks in the ranks, I&#x2019;ll put him to death!&#x201d; One American yelled at Cockburn that if George Washington were still alive, &#x201c;you could not have done this.&#x201d; The Admiral replied that George Washington, unlike Madison, would never have &#x201c;left his capital defenseless, for the purpose of making conquest abroad.&#x201d;<br><br> Bursting into the White House, Cockburn&#x2019;s soldiers sat down at the dining table&#x2014;still set with crystal, gold, and silver&#x2014;and feasted on the Madisons&#x2019; uneaten Virginia hams and &#x201c;super-excellent Madeira.&#x201d; Marching upstairs into the President&#x2019;s private dressing room, whose opened drawers betrayed a hasty departure, Cockburn seized the black bicorne military hat owned by the man he derided as &#x201c;Little Jemmy Madison&#x201d; and merrily stuck it on the tip of his bayonet. Stealing a seat cushion from Dolley&#x2019;s boudoir, Cockburn made ribald jokes about her voluptuous derriere and breasts. Other redcoats donned the President&#x2019;s starchy shirt and waved his ceremonial sword. Madison&#x2019;s guitar and pianoforte, a half-packed portmanteau, and French sofas and commodes purchased by Thomas Jefferson were all gathered and shoved into a pile in the Mansion&#x2019;s grand oval reception room. These and other spoils of war were lit by perhaps fifty torches, each charged with glowing coals from a nearby tavern. Soon, it was said, the Mansion was &#x201c;wrapt in one entire flame.&#x201d; Cockburn reputedly finished his night of destruction at a nearby brothel, reveling in &#x201c;the coarse luxury of lust.&#x201d;<br><br> James Madison, who had done so much to conceive the political institutions of Washington, DC, was reviled by many of his fellow citizens as the destroyer of their capital city. Vicious handbills appeared, demanding that the President receive a &#x201c;black and bitter day of retribution&#x201d; for &#x201c;this foul stain on our national character.&#x201d; They called him a &#x201c;coward&#x201d; who had fled his White House command post for Virginia, &#x201c;begging&#x201d; shelter and bread &#x201c;from door to door&#x201d;&#x2014;and a cad, leaving poor Dolley &#x201c;to shift for herself.&#x201d; Such attacks stung the proud Madison. But his ordeal was more profound.<br><br> The War of 1812 was the first major conflict conducted by a President of the United States under the document of which Madison was justly revered as the &#x201c;Father.&#x201d; During the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia, Madison and the other Founders had debated the quandaries of war. They sought to ensure that, unlike in the Old World societies governed by sovereigns, Americans would go to war only when it was absolutely necessary&#x2014;and that the decision would be made not by the President but by the legislature. Virginia&#x2019;s George Mason had written that he was &#x201c;ag[ainst] giving the power of war to the Executive, because [that branch was] not safely to be trusted with it.&#x201d; James Wilson of Pennsylvania insisted that the Constitution &#x201c;will not hurry us into war; it is calculated to guard against it.&#x201d; Madison himself considered war &#x201c;the true nurse of executive aggrandizement.&#x201d; As he reminded Jefferson in 1798, &#x201c;The constitution supposes, what the History of all Gov[ernmen]ts demonstrates, that the Ex[ecutive] Is the branch of power most interested in war, &amp; most prone to it. It has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the Legisl[ative].&#x201d;[3]<br><br> The 1812 conflict proved to be the first major test of the constitutional system for waging war. In Philadelphia, Madison the Founder had worried that American Presidents, like the European monarchs they execrated, might be tempted to take the nation into military confrontation without a national consensus and an immediate, overwhelming foreign danger. But with the War of 1812, Madison had, however reluctantly, succumbed to exactly that temptation. Much of the country and Congress had opposed waging war with Great Britain, and two years into this struggle, many Americans still did not fully understand why they were fighting.<br><br> By leading his country into a major war that had no absolute necessity or overwhelming support from Congress and the public, Madison, of all people, had opened the door for later Presidents to seek involvement in future conflicts that suffered from such shortcomings. Madison&#x2019;s fateful decision to seek this war had brought him, after midnight, to this dark Virginia forest, searching for Dolley and running for his life.<br> &nbsp;<br>[1] The President&#x2019;s residence was not officially called the White House until President Theodore Roosevelt issued an executive order to this effect in 1901, but the term was occasionally used during Madison&#x2019;s time.<br>[2] General John Armstrong Jr. was Secretary of War.<br>[3] Early in the process, Congress was to be given authority to &#x201c;make&#x201d; war, but Madison and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts successfully changed that word to the more specific &#x201c;declare,&#x201d; so the record shows, &#x201c;leaving to the Executive the power to repel sudden attacks.&#x201d;</p><h2>High Lonesome: A Novel</h2><p>Considine and Pete Runyon had once been friends, back in the days when both were cowhands.

It was the terminus of the Silk Road, the furthest end of the known world, a fertile source of inspiration for European artists, and an enduring symbol of the mysterious East. In recent times, it has become a powerhouse of global industry, a nexus of popular culture, and a harbinger of post-industrial decline. <br><br>With intelligence and wit, author Jonathan Clements blends documentary and storytelling styles to connect the past, present and future of Japan, and in broad yet detailed strokes reveals a country of paradoxes: a modern nation steeped in ancient traditions; a democracy with an emperor as head of state; a famously safe society built on 108 volcanoes resting on the world's most active earthquake zone; a fast-paced urban and technologically advanced country whose land consists predominantly of mountains and forests. <br><br> <b>Among the chapters in this Japanese history book are:</b><ul><li> The Way of the Gods: Prehistoric and Mythical Japan</li><li> A Game of Thrones: Minamoto vs. Taira</li><li> Time Warp: 200 Years of Isolation</li><li> The Stench of Butter: Restoration and Modernization</li><li> The New Breed: The Japanese Miracle</li></ul></p><p><b>Jonathan Clements</b> is the author of <i>Christ's Samurai: The True Story of the Shimabara Rebellion, A Brief History of the Samurai, Modern Japan: All That Matters, Anime: A History</i>, and biographies of Admiral Togo and Prince Saionji Kinmochi.

Music, the author contends, is a continually evolving art, and all geniuses, unique as they are, were influenced by their predecessors. Schonberg discusses the lives and works of the foremost figures in classical music, among them Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, the Schumanns, Copland, and Stravinsky, weaving a fabric rich in detail and anecdote. He also includes the creators of light music, such as Gilbert and Sullivan and the Strausses.<br><br> Schonberg has extended the volume's coverage to provide informative and clearly written descriptions of the later serialists such as Stockhausen and Carter, the iconoclastic John Cage, the individualistic Messiaen, minimalist composers, the new tonalists, and women composers of all eras, including Mendelssohn Hensel, Chaminade, Smyth, Beach, and Zwilich. Scattered throughout are many changes and additions reflecting musicological findings of the past fifteen years. Photographs</p><p>Harold C. Schonberg, senior New York Times music critic for twenty years, was the first in his field to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism (1971). He is the author of many articles and eight books, including one on chess. Schonberg lives in New York City.This third edition of a work that has become a standard resource since its publication in 1981 includes brief but significant changes. A new chapter brings the work up to date, covering later serialists such as Stockhausen and Carter, minimalists Philip Glass and John Adams, and Alfred Schnittke and Peter Maxwell Davies. Schonberg discusses the recent phenomenal success of recordings of Gregorian chant and the search for styles of composition that combine originality and complexity with audience appeal. Women composers Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, Amy Beach, Cecile Chaminade, Ethel Smyth, and Ellen Taaffe Zwilich are now included. Though each has been given only one paragraph, it is valuable to see them placed in the context of their contemporaries and their predecessors. Schonberg writes for the lay reader. His intention is to humanize the composers and the writing, always highly readable, emphasizes biographical information rather than musical analysis.

Taylor, a reprint of his influential text <i>The Origins of the Second World War.</i> Controversial for his thesis that Hitler was an opportunist with no thorough plan, <i>The Origins of the Second World War</i> is an extensive exploration of the international politics and foreign policy that lead up to the one of the bloodiest conflicts of the 20th century.<br><br>Published in 1961,<i> The Origins of the Second World War</i> is a classic of modern history. A.J.P. Taylor's years of research helped change the long-accepted view that Adolf Hitler had wanted and planned in detail for a war. With clear and relatable prose, Taylor articularly depicts the diplomatic mistakes from both the Allied and Axis powers that lead to the outbreak of World War II.

He wrote several seminal texts on 19th and 20th century history, his most famous and controversial being <i>The Origins of the Second World War</i>, published in 1961. Along with writing books, Taylor also worked extensively in print and broadcast journalism. Married three times, he had six children.

The Empire has been toppled by the triumphant Rebel Alliance, and the New Republic is ascendant. But the struggle against the dark side and the Sith Order is not over. Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Lando Calrissian, and their faithful comrades have had little time to savor victory before being called on to defend the newly liberated galaxy.<br><br>Powerful remnants of the vanquished Empire, hungry for retaliation, are still at large, committing acts of piracy, terrorism, and wholesale slaughter against the worlds of the fledgling New Republic. The most deadly of these, a ruthless legion of black-armored Stormtroopers, do the brutal bidding of the newly risen warlord Shadowspawn. Striking from a strategically advantageous base on the planet Mindor, they are waging a campaign of plunder and destruction, demolishing order and security across the galaxy&#x2013;and breeding fears of an Imperial resurgence. Another reign of darkness beneath the boot-heel of Sith despotism is something General Luke Skywalker cannot, and will not, risk. <br><br>Mobilizing the ace fighters of Rogue Squadron&#x2013;along with the trusty Chewbacca, See-Threepio, and Artoo-Detoo&#x2013;Luke, Han, and Leia set out to take the battle to the enemy and neutralize the threat before it&#x2019;s too late. But their imminent attack on Mindor will be playing directly into the hands of their cunning new adversary.

The Emperor&#x2019;s death has paved the way for Shadowspawn&#x2019;s return from exile in the Outer Rim, and mastery of ancient Sith knowledge and modern technology has given him the capability to mount the ultimate power play for galaxy wide dominion.

Rumor had it that for the price of a single cocktail in one of the <i>Queen</i>&#x2019;s least- exclusive dining clubs, one might buy a starship; for the price of a meal, one could buy not only the starship, but the port in which it docked, and the factory that had built it. A being could not simply <i>pay for </i>a berth on the <i>Corellian Queen; </i>mere wealth would never suffice. To embark upon the ultimate journey into hedonistic excess, one first had to demonstrate that one&#x2019;s breeding and manners were as exquisite as would be the pain of paying one&#x2019;s bar bill. All of which made the <i>Corellian Queen </i>one of the most irresistible terrorist targets ever: who better to terrorize than the elite of the Elite, the Powers among the powerful, the greatest of the Great?<br><br>And so when some presumably unscrupulous routing clerk in the<br>vast midreaches of the Nebula Line corporation quietly offered for<br>sale, to select parties from Kindlabethia to Nar Shaddaa, a hint as to<br>the route of the <i>Corellian Queen</i>&#x2019;s upcoming cruise, it attracted considerable interest.<br><br>Two pertinent facts remained concealed, however, from the winning<br>bidder. The first pertinent fact was that this presumably unscrupulous<br>routing clerk was neither unscrupulous nor, in fact, a<br>routing clerk, but was a skilled and resourceful agent of the intelligence<br>service of the New Republic. The second pertinent fact was<br>that the <i>Corellian Queen </i>was not cruising at all that season, having<br>been replaced by a breakaway disposable shell built to conceal a substantial fraction of a star fighter wing, led by&#x2014;as was customary in such operations&#x2014;the crack pilots of Rogue Squadron.<br><br>It was approximately the moment that R4-G7 squalled a proximity<br>alarm through his X-wing&#x2019;s sensor panel and his HUD lit up<br>with image codes for six TIE Defenders on his tail that Lieutenant<br>Derek &#x201c;Hobbie&#x201d; Klivian, late of the Alliance to Restore Freedom to<br>the Galaxy, currently of the New Republic, began to suspect that<br>Commander Antilles&#x2019;s brilliant ambush had never been brilliant at<br>all, not even a little, and he said so. In no uncertain terms. Stripped<br>of its blistering profanity, his comment was &#x201c;Wedge? This plan was<br><i>stupid. </i>You hear me? Stupid, stupid, stu<i>YOW&#x2014;</i>!&#x201d;<br><br>The <i>yow </i>was a product of multiple cannon hits that disintegrated<br>his right dorsal cannon and most of the extended wing it had been<br>attached to. This kicked his fighter into a tumble that he fought with<br>both hands on the yoke and both feet kicking attitude jets and almost<br>had under control until the pair of the Defenders closest on his tail<br>blossomed into expanding spheres of flame and debris fragments.<br><br>The twin shock fronts overtook him at exactly the wrong instant and<br>sent him flipping end- over- end straight at another Defender formation<br>streaking toward him head- on. Then tail- on, then head- on<br>again, and so forth.<br><br>His ship&#x2019;s comlink crackled as Wedge Antilles&#x2019;s fighter flashed<br>past him close enough that he could see the grin on the commander&#x2019;s<br>face. <i>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s &#x2018;stupid plan, </i>sir,<i>&#x2019; Lieutenant.&#x201d;<br><br></i>&#x201c;I suppose you think that&#x2019;s funny.&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Well, if he doesn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; </i>put in Hobbie&#x2019;s wingman, <i>&#x201c;I sure do.&#x201d;<br><br></i>&#x201c;When I want <i>your </i>opinion, Janson, I&#x2019;ll dust your ship and scan<br>for it in the wreckage.&#x201d; The skewed whirl of stars around his cockpit<br>gave his stomach a yank that threatened to make the slab of smoked<br>terrafin loin he&#x2019;d had for breakfast violently reemerge. Struggling<br>grimly with the controls, he managed to angle his ship&#x2019;s whirl just a<br>hair, which let him twitch his ship&#x2019;s nose toward the four pursuing<br>marauders as he spun. Red fire lashed from his three surviving<br>cannons, and the Defenders&#x2019; formation split open like an overripe<br>snekfruit.<br><br>Hobbie only dusted one with the cannons, but the pair of<br>proximity- fused flechette torpedoes he had thoughtfully triggered at<br>the same time flared in diverging arcs to intercept the enemy fighters;<br>these torpedo arcs terminated in spectacular explosions that<br>cracked the three remaining Defenders like rotten snuffle eggs.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, <i>that </i>was satisfying,&#x201d; he said, still fighting his controls to<br>stabilize the crippled X-wing. &#x201c;Eyeball souffl�!&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Better watch it, Hobbie&#x2014;keep that up, and somebody might start to<br>think you can fly that thing.&#x201d;<br><br></i>&#x201c;Are you <i>in </i>this fight, Janson? Or are you just gonna hang back<br>and smirk while I do all the heavy lifting?&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t decided yet.&#x201d; </i>Wes Janson&#x2019;s X-wing came out of nowhere,<br>streaking in a tight bank across Hobbie&#x2019;s subjective vertical. <i>&#x201c;Maybe<br>I can lend a hand. Or, say, a couple torps.&#x201d;<br><br></i>Two brilliant blue stars leapt from Janson&#x2019;s torpedo tubes and<br>streaked for the oncoming TIEs.<br><br>&#x201c;Uh, Wes?&#x201d; Hobbie said, flinching. &#x201c;Those weren&#x2019;t the flechette<br>torps, were they?&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Sure. What else?&#x201d;<br><br></i>&#x201c;Have you noticed that I&#x2019;m currently having just a little trouble<br><i>maneuvering</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>What do you mean?</i>&#x201d; Janson asked as though honestly puzzled.<br><br>Then, after a second spent watching Hobbie&#x2019;s ship tumbling helplessly<br>directly toward his torpedoes&#x2019; targets, he said, <i>&#x201c;Oh. Uh . . .sorry?&#x201d;<br></i><br>The flechette torpedoes carried by Rogue Squadron had been designed<br>and built specifically for this operation, and they had one primary<br>purpose: to take out TIE Defenders.<br><br>The TIE Defender was the Empire&#x2019;s premier space- superiority<br>fighter. It was faster and more maneuverable than the Incom T-65<br>(better known as the X-wing); faster even than the heavily modified<br>and updated 65Bs of Rogue Squadron. The Defender was also more<br>heavily armed, packing twin ion cannons to supplement its lasers, as<br>well as dual- use launch tubes that could fire either proton torpedoes<br>or concussion missiles. The shields generated by its twin Novaldex<br>deflector generators were nearly as powerful as those found on capital<br>ships. However, the Defenders were not equipped with particle<br>shields, depending instead on their titanium- reinforced hull to absorb<br>the impact of material objects.<br><br>Each proton torpedo shell had been loaded with thousands of tiny<br>jagged bits of durasteel, packed around a core of conventional explosive.<br><br>On detonation, these tiny bits of durasteel became an expanding<br>sphere of shrapnel; though traveling with respectable velocity of<br>their own, they were most effective when set off in the path of oncoming<br>Defenders, because impact energy, after all, is determined by<br><i>relative </i>velocity. At star fighter combat speeds, flying into a cloud of<br>durasteel pellets could transform one&#x2019;s ship from a star fighter into a<br>very, very expensive cheese grater.<br><br>The four medial fighters of the oncoming Defender formation hit<br>the flechette cloud and just . . . shredded. The lateral wingers managed<br>to bank off an instant before they would have been overtaken<br>by two sequential detonations, as the explosion of one Defender&#x2019;s<br>power core triggered the other three&#x2019;s cores an eyeblink later, so that<br>the unfortunate Lieutenant Klivian was now tumbling directly<br>toward a miniature plasma nebula that blazed with enough hard radiation<br>to cook him like a bantha steak on an obsidian fry- rock at<br>double noon on Tatooine.<br><br><i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not gonna make it, Hobbie,&#x201d; </i>Janson called. <i>&#x201c;Punch out.&#x201d;<br><br></i>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;d <i>like </i>that, wouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Hobbie snarled under his<br>breath, still struggling grimly with the X-wing&#x2019;s controls.

He reached for the<br>eject trigger.<br><br>Just as his hand found the trigger, the ship jounced and clanged as<br>if he had his head trapped inside a Wookiee dinner gong at nightmeal.<br><br>The metaphorical Wookiee cook must have been hungry, too,<br>because the clanging went on and on and kept getting louder, and<br>the eject still, mysteriously, didn&#x2019;t seem to be working at all. This<br>mystery was solved, however, by the brief shriek of atmosphere<br>through a ragged fist- sized hole in the X- wing&#x2019;s canopy. This hole<br>was ragged because, Hobbie discovered, the fragment that had made<br>this opening had been slowed by punching through the X- wing&#x2019;s<br>titanium- alloy ventral armor. Not to mention the X- wing&#x2019;s control<br>panel, where it had not only ripped away the entire eject trigger assembly,<br>but had vaporized Hobbie&#x2019;s left hand.<br><br>He glared at his vacant wrist with more annoyance than shock or<br>panic; instead of blood or cauterized flesh, his wrist jetted only<br>sparks and smoke from overheated servomotors. He hadn&#x2019;t had a<br>real left arm since sometime before Yavin.<br><br>Of more concern was the continuing shriek of escaping atmosphere,<br>because he discovered that it was coming from his environment<br>suit&#x2019;s nitroxy generator.<br><br>He thought, <i>Oh, this sucks. </i>After everything he had survived in the<br>Galactic Civil War, he was about to be killed by a minor equipment<br>malfunction.

His suit&#x2019;s autoseal<br>plastered itself to the jagged edges, but the nitroxy generator didn&#x2019;t<br>seem mollified; in fact, it was starting to feel like he had an unshielded<br>fusion core strapped to his spine.<br><br><i>Oh, yeah, </i>he thought. <i>The other hole.<br><br></i>He palmed the cockpit harness&#x2019;s snap release, twisted, and<br>stretched out his left leg, feeling downward with the toe of his boot.<br><br>He found a hole&#x2014;and the rising pressure sucked the entire boot<br>right out the bottom of his fighter before the autoseal engaged to<br>close that hole, too. He felt another impact or two down there, but<br>he couldn&#x2019;t really tell if something might have ripped his foot off.<br><br>It had been a few years since he&#x2019;d had his original left leg.<br><br>With the cockpit sealed, his nitroxy unit gradually calmed down,<br>filling the space with a breathable atmosphere that smelled only<br>faintly of scorched hair, and he began to think he might live through<br>this after all.

After a while, he found this image unconvincing&#x2014;somehow<br>he was never that lucky&#x2014;and so he cycled through the other<br>Rogues, and when those began to bore him, he decided it&#x2019;d be Luke<br>himself. Or Leia. Or, say, Wynssa Starflare, who always managed to<br>look absolutely stellar as the strong, independent damsel- sometimesin-<br>distress in those pre- war Imperial holodramas, because, y&#x2019;know,<br>as long as he was imagining something that was never gonna happen,<br>he might as well make it entertaining.<br><br>It turned out to be entertaining enough that he managed to pass<br>the balance of the battle drifting off to sleep with a smile on his face.<br><br>This smile lasted right up to the point where a particularly brilliant<br>flash stabbed through his eyelids and he awoke, glumly certain<br>that whatever had exploded right next to his ship was finally about to<br>snuff him. But then there came another flash, and another, and with<br>a painful twist of his body he was able to see Wes Janson&#x2019;s fighter<br>cruising alongside, only meters away. He was also able to see the<br>handheld imager Janson had pressed against his cockpit&#x2019;s canopy,<br>with which Janson continued to snap picture after picture.<br><br>Hobbie closed his eyes again. He would have preferred the explosion.<br><br><i>&#x201c;Just had to get a few shots.&#x201d; </i>Janson&#x2019;s grin was positively wicked.<br><br><i>&#x201c;You look like some kind of weird cross between a star fighter pilot and a Bat -<br>ravian gumplucker.&#x201d;<br><br></i>Hobbie shook his head exhaustedly; dealing with Janson&#x2019;s pathetic<br>excuse for a sense of humor always made him tired. &#x201c;Wes, I don&#x2019;t<br>even know what that is.&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Sure you do, Hobbie.

This passage, he argues, has brought profound change to all aspects of the human condition. The new remoteness and un-reachability of global systemic structure coupled with the unstructured and under-defined, fluid state of the immediate setting of life-politics and human togetherness, call for the rethinking of the concepts and cognitive frames used to narrate human individual experience and their joint history. <br> <p>This book is dedicated to this task. Bauman selects five of the basic concepts which have served to make sense of shared human life - emancipation, individuality, time/space, work and community - and traces their successive incarnations and changes of meaning.<br> </p> <p><i>Liquid Modernity</i> concludes the analysis undertaken in Bauman's two previous books <i>Globalization: The Human Consequences</i> and <i>In Search of Politics</i>. Together these volumes form a brilliant analysis of the changing conditions of social and political life by one of the most original thinkers writing today.</p></p><p><b>Zygmunt Bauman</b> (1925-2017) was Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the Universities of Leeds and Warsaw."Bauman on a bad day is still far more stimulating than most contemporary social thinkers. He is the Georg Simmel of our age, and his books and essays will be read when contemporary exponents of social arithmetic are long forgotten." <br> <b><i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b> <p>"<i>Liquid Modernity</i> is Zygmunt Bauman's term for the present condition of the world as contrasted with the 'solid' modernity that preceded it ... He is a vivid and original writer with an eye for the revealing personal experience.'<br> </p> <p><b>Dennis Wrong, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br> </p> <p>"Zygmunt Bauman can be counted among those giants of sociology - C. Wright Mills, �mile Durkheim, Max Weber - who are bound together not by a shared ideological or disciplinary alignment, but by a profound and moral passion. I do not employ the term "moral" in the commonly used sense of "judgmental", but to describe their ability to define the spirit of the age, to ask cutting questions about society's direction, warn of dangers and perceive opportunities."<br> </p> <p><i><b>Contemporary Politics</b></i><br> </p> <p>"These books mark an important advance in Bauman's project. He seems to be trying to bring the intellectuals back into the game, twitting them for their passivity. Bauman wants social critics to take a more active role, taking a lead by showing how the relationships between individuals and society and between the private and public spheres may be rearticulated and the spirit of the <i>agora</i> restored to social and political life."<br> </p> <p><i><b>British Journal of Sociology</b></i><br> </p> <p>"His work is essential reading for those political theorist who feel that part of their task is to elaborate relevant and compelling normative critique."<br> </p> <p><i><b>Contemporary Political Theory</b></i><br> </p> <p>"Bauman lucidly depicts what others call the 'postmodern situation' a term that he painstakingly avoids, and his analysis is important for anyone interested in cultural criticism"<br> </p> <p><b>Caterina Norlin-Brage, <i>Religious Studies Review</i></b><br> </p> <p>"One of post-modernity's great commentators."<br> </p> <p><b>Pete Ward, <i>Church Times</i></b></p></p><h2>Jamie Oliver&#39;s Meals in Minutes: A Revolutionary Approach to Cooking Good Food Fast</h2><p><strong>I'm going to show you how to put a whole meal on the table in a matter of minutes!

Why do financially sensible people jump lemming-like into hare-brained speculative frenzies--only to jump broker-like out of windows when their fantasies dissolve? We may think that the Great Crash of 1929, junk bonds of the '80s, and over-valued high-tech stocks of the '90s are peculiarly 20th century aberrations, but Mackay's classic--first published in 1841--shows that the madness and confusion of crowds knows no limits, and has no temporal bounds. These are extraordinarily illuminating,and, unfortunately, entertaining tales of chicanery, greed and naivete. Essential reading for any student of human nature or the transmission of ideas. <p> </p><p> In fact, cases such as Tulipomania in 1624--when Tulip bulbs traded at a higher price than gold--suggest the existence of what I would dub "Mackay's Law of Mass Action:" when it comes to the effect of social behavior on the intelligence of individuals, 1+1 is often less than 2, and sometimes considerably less than 0.</p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>My Life with Bonnie and Clyde</h2><p><p>Bonnie and Clyde were responsible for multiple murders and countless robberies. But they did not act alone. In 1933, during their infamous run from the law, Bonnie and Clyde were joined by Clyde&#x2019;s brother Buck Barrow and his wife Blanche. Of these four accomplices, only one&#x2015;Blanche Caldwell Barrow&#x2015;lived beyond early adulthood and only Blanche left behind a written account of their escapades. Edited by outlaw expert John Neal Phillips, Blanche&#x2019;s previously unknown memoir is here available for the first time.</p> <p>Blanche wrote her memoir between 1933 and 1939, while serving time at the Missouri State Penitentiary. Following her death, Blanche&#x2019;s good friend and the executor of her will, Esther L. Weiser, found the memoir wrapped in a large unused Christmas card. Later she entrusted it to Phillips, who had interviewed Blanche several times before her death. Drawing from these interviews, and from extensive research into Depression-era outlaw history, Phillips supplements the memoir with helpful notes and with biographical information about Blanche and her accomplices.</p></p><p><p><b>Blanche Caldwell Barrow</b> was the wife of Marvin "Buck" Barrow and the sister-in-law of Clyde Barrow.

Recently, however, players have been gravitating to another, even more complex form of hold em no-limit cash games. <p> In Harrington on Cash Games: Volume I, Dan Harrington teaches you the key concepts that drive deep-stack cash game play. You ll learn how to tailor your selection of starting hands to your stack size, how to recognize the increasing deception value of supposedly weaker hands as the stack sizes increase, and how to use the concept of pot commitment to your advantage as the size of the pot grows. After laying out the general concepts behind deep-stack cash game play, Harrington shows you a complete strategy for post-flop play, and then teaches you the difference between post-flop play against a single opponent and post-flop play against multiple opponents. If you play no-limit hold em cash games, you need to read this book. </p><p> Dan Harrington won the gold bracelet and the World Champion title at the $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Hold em Championship at the 1995 World Series of Poker. And he was the only player to make the final table in 2003 (field of 839) and 2004 (field of 2,576) considered by cognoscenti to be the greatest accomplishment in WSOP history. In Harrington on Cash Games, Harrington and two-time World Backgammon Champion Bill Robertie have written the definitive books on no-limit cash games. These books will teach you what you need to know to be a winner in the cash game world.</p></p><p>Dan Harrington began playing poker professionally in 1982. On the circuit he is known as Action Dan, an ironic reference to his solid but effective style. He has won several major no-limit hold em tournaments including the European Poker Championships (1995), the $2,500 No-Limit Hold em event at the 1995 World Series of Poker, and the Four Queens No-Limit Hold em Championship (1996). <p>Dan began his serious games-playing with chess, where he quickly became a master and one of the strongest players in the New England area. In 1972 he won the Massachusetts Chess Championship, ahead of most of the top players in the area. In 1976 he started playing backgammon, a game which he also quickly mastered. He was soon one of the top money players in the Boston area, and in 1981 he won the World Cup of backgammon in Washington D.C., ahead of a field that included most of the world s top players. </p><p>He first played in the $10,000 No-Limit Hold em Championship Event of the World Series of Poker in 1987. He has played in the championship a total of 15 times and has reached the final table in four of those tournaments, an amazing record. Besides winning the World Championship in 1995, he finished sixth in 1987, third in 2003, and fourth in 2004. In 2006 he finished second at the Doyle Brunson North American Championships at the Bellagio, while in 2007 he won the Legends of Poker tournament at the Bicycle Club. He is widely recognized as one of the greatest and most respected no-limit hold em players, as well as a feared opponent in both no-limit and limit hold em side games. He lives in Santa Monica where he is a partner in Anchor Loans, a real estate business. </p><p>Bill Robertie has spent his life playing and writing about chess, backgammon, and now poker. He began playing chess as a boy, inspired by Bobby Fischer s feats on the international chess scene. While attending Harvard as an undergraduate, he became a chess master and helped the Harvard chess team win several intercollegiate titles. After graduation, he won a number of chess tournaments, including the United States Championship at speed chess in 1970. He also established a reputation at blindfold chess, giving exhibitions on as many as eight boards simultaneously. </p><p> In 1976 he switched from chess to backgammon, becoming one of the top players in the world. His major titles include the World Championship in Monte Carlo in 1983 and 1987, the Black &amp; White Championship in Boston in 1979, the Las Vegas tournaments in 1980 and 2001, the Bahamas Pro-Am in 1993, and the Istanbul World Open in 1994. </p><p>He has written several well-regarded backgammon books, the most noted of which are Advanced Backgammon (1991), a two-volume collection of 400 problems, and Modern Backgammon (2002), a new look at the underlying theory of the game. He has also written a set of three books for the beginning player: Backgammon for Winners (1994), Backgammon for Serious Players (1995), and 501 Essential Backgammon Problems (1997). </p><p>From 1991 to 1998 he edited the magazine Inside Backgammon with Kent Goulding. He owns a publishing company, the Gammon Press, and lives in Arlington, Massachusetts with his wife Patrice.</p></p><h2>Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>Rhetoric was once an essential part of western education. Aristotle wrote an important treatise on it and Demosthenes remains famous to this day for his skills as a rhetorician. But skill with rhetoric today is no longer admired. Rhetoric is often seen as a synonym for shallow, deceptive language-empty words, empty rhetoric--and therefore as something quite negative. But if we view rhetoric in more neutral terms, as the "art of persuasion," it is clear that we are all forced to engage with it at some level, if only because we are constantly exposed to the rhetoric of others. In this Very Short Introduction, Richard Toye explores the purpose of rhetoric. Rather than presenting a defense of it, he considers it as the foundation-stone of civil society, and an essential part of any democratic process. Using wide-ranging examples from ancient Greece, medieval Islamic preaching, the wartime speeches of Winston Churchill, and modern cinema, Toye considers why we should all have an appreciation of the art of rhetoric. <br><br>About the Series:<br><br>Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every Very Short Introduction gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. Whatever the area of study that one deems important or appealing, whatever the topic that fascinates the general reader, the Very Short Introductions series has a handy and affordable guide that will likely prove indispensable.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Toye</strong> is Professor of Modern History at the University of Exeter. His books include <em>Lloyd George and Churchill: Rivals for Greatness </em>and<em> Churchill's Empire: The World That Made Him and the World He Made.</em><br>Rhetoric matters. To explicate this shaggy beast in 35,000 words is no small challenge, and Toye succeeds with a consistently light touch. * The Speechwriter *</p><h2>Anatomy Coloring Book</h2><p><b>Coloring the body and its systems is the most effective way to study the structure and functions of human anatomy.

It is snuffed out by the crude forces of violence, insensibility, and vulgarity that existin our South &#x2014; and this is the cry of the play.<br><br>Style: One reason a &#x201c; style,&#x201d; a stylized production, is necessary is that Blanche&#x2019;s memories, inner life, emotions are a tangible, actual factor.We cannot understand her behavior unless we see the effect of her past on her present behavior.<br><br>This play is a poetic tragedy. We are shown the final dissolution of a person of worth, who once had great potential, and who, even as she is defeated, as she is destroyed, has a worth exceeding that of the &#x201c;healthy,&#x201d; coarse-grained figures who kill her.<br><br>Blanche and Don Quixote are both emblems of the death of an old culture. This is a poetic tragedy, not a realistic, naturalistic one. The acting must be styled, not in the obvious sense. (Say nothing about this to the producer and actors.) But you will fail unless you find this kind of poetic realization for these people&#x2019;s behavior. <br><br>Blanche is a social type, an emblem of a dying civilization, making its last curlicued and romantic exit. All her behavior patterns are those of the dying civilization she represents. In other words, her behavior is social. Therefore find social modes! This is the source of the play&#x2019;s stylization and the production&#x2019;s style and color. Likewise, Stanley&#x2019;s behavior is social too. It is the basic animal cynicism of today. &#x201c; Get what&#x2019;s coming to you! Don&#x2019;t waste a day! Eat, drink, get yours!&#x201d; This is the basis of his stylization, of the choice of his props. All props should be stylized: They should have a color, shape, and weight that spell <i>style</i>.<br><br>An effort to put poetic names on scenes to edge me into stylizations and physicalizations. Try to keep each scene in terms of Blanche.<br><br>1. Blanche comes to the last stop at the end of the line.<br>2. Blanche tries to make a place for herself.<br>3. Blanche breaks them [Stanley and Stella] apart, but when they come together, Blanche is more alone than ever!<br>4. Blanche, more desperate because more excluded, tries the<br>direct attack and creates the enemy who will finish her.<br>5. Blanche finds that she is being tracked down for the kill. She must work fast.<br>6. Blanche suddenly finds Mitch, suddenly makes for herself the only possible, perfect man for her.<br>7. Happy only for a moment, Blanche comes out of the bathroom to find that her doom has caught up with her.<br>8. Blanche fights her last fight. Breaks down. Even Stella deserts her.<br>9. Blanche&#x2019;s last desperate effort to save herself by telling the whole truth. The truth dooms her.<br>10. Blanche escapes out of this world. She is brought back by Stanley and destroyed.<br>11. Blanche is disposed of.<br><br>Find an entirely different character, a self-dramatized and selfromanticized character for Blanche to play in each scene, as if she were playing eleven different people. This will give the play the kind of changeable and shimmering surface it should have. And all these eleven self-dramatized and romantic characters should derive from the romantic tradition of the Pre-Bellum South. For example, in Scene 2 she is &#x201c;Gay Miss Devil-May-Care.&#x201d;<br><br>The style &#x2014; the real deep style &#x2014; consists of one thing only: to find behavior that&#x2019;s truly social, significantly typical, at each moment. It&#x2019;s not so much what Blanche has done, it&#x2019;s how she does it &#x2014; with such style, grace, manners, old-world trappings and effects, props, tricks, swirls, etc., that they seem anything but vulgar.<br><br>And for the other characters, too, you face the same problem, to find the Don Quixote character for them. Stylized acting and direction is to realistic acting and direction as poetry is to prose. This is a poetic tragedy, not a realistic or a naturalistic one. So you must find a Don Quixote scheme of things for each.<br>Stanley.<br>A kind of na�vet�, even slowness. He means no harm. He wants to knock no one down. Only he doesn&#x2019;t want to be taken advantage of. His code is simple and simple-minded. He is adjusted &#x2014; now. Later, as the power of his penis dies, so will he, the trouble will come later, the &#x201c;problems.&#x201d;<br><br>But what&#x2019;s the chink in his armor now, the contradiction? Why does Blanche get so completely under his skin? Why does he want to bring Blanche, as he brought Stella, down to his level? It&#x2019;s as if he said: &#x201c; I know I haven&#x2019;t got much, but no one has more and no one&#x2019;s going to have more.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s the hoodlum aristocrat, and he&#x2019;s deeply dissatisfied, deeply hopeless, deeply cynical. The physical immediate pleasures, if they come in a steady enough stream, quiet his resentments, as long<br>as no one else gets more than he does. If they do, then his bitterness spills out and he trashes the pretender. But he can&#x2019;t seem to do anything with Blanche, so he levels her with his sex. He pulls her down and crushes her.<br><br>One of the important things about Stanley is that Blanche would wreck his home. Blanche is dangerous. She is destructive (like Stella Adler). Soon she would have him and Stella fighting. He&#x2019;s got the things the way he wants them around there, and he does not want them upset by a phony, corrupt, sick, destructive woman. T<i>his makes Stanley right!</i> Are we going into the era of Stanley? He may be practical and right, but what the hell does it leave us? Make this a personal objective<br>characterization for Marlon Brando. Choose Marlon&#x2019;s objects. The things he loves and prizes, all sensuous and sensual: the shirt, the cigar, the beer (how it&#x2019;s poured and nursed).<br><br>Stanley is exactly like you in some ways. He&#x2019;s supremely indifferent to everything except his own pleasure and comfort. He is marvelously selfish, a miracle of sensuous self-centeredness. He builds a hedonist life, and fights to the death to defend it &#x2014; but finally it is not enough to hold Stella. And this philosophy is not successful even for him &#x2014; because every once in a while the silenced, frustrated part of Stanley breaks loose in unexpected and unpredictable ways and we suddenly see, as in a burst of lightning, his real frustrated self. Usually his frustration is worked off by eating a lot, drinking a lot, gambling a lot, fornicating a lot. He&#x2019;s going to get very fat later. He&#x2019;s desperately trying to squeeze out happiness by living by <i>ball and jowl</i>, and it really doesn&#x2019;t work because it simply stores up violence until<i> every bar in the nation</i> <i>is full of Stanleys ready to explode</i>. He&#x2019;s desperately trying to drug his senses, overwhelming them with a constant round of sensation so that he will feel nothing else.<br><br>For Stanley sex goes under a disguise. Nothing is more erotic and arousing to him than &#x201c; airs.&#x201d; &#x201c; She thinks she&#x2019;s better than me. I&#x2019;ll show her.&#x201d; Sex equals domination, anything that challenges him &#x2014; like calling him &#x201c; common &#x201d; &#x2014; arouses him sexually.<br><br>In the case of Brando, the question of enjoyment is particularly important. Stanley feeds himself. His world is hedonistic. But what does he enjoy? Sex equals sadism. He conquers with his prick. But objects too: drink, conquest in poker, food, sweat, exercise. But enjoy. Not just cruelly unpleasant, but he never matured, never grew up from the baby who wants a constant nipple in his mouth. He yells when it is taken away.<br><br>Stanley has got things his way. He fits into his environment. The culture and the civilization, even the neighborhood, the food, the drink, etc., are all his way. And he&#x2019;s got a great girl, with just enough hidden neuroticism for him &#x2014; yet not enough to threaten a real fight. Also, their history is right: He conquered her. Their relationship is right: She waits up for him. Finally, God and Nature gave him a fine sensory apparatus . . . he enjoys! The main thing the actor has to do in the early scenes<br>is make the physical environment of Stanley, the <i>props</i>, come to life.<br><br>Stanley is deeply indifferent. When he first meets Blanche, he doesn&#x2019;t really seem to care if she stays or not. Stanley is interested in his own pleasures. He is completely self-absorbed to the point of fascination. To physicalize this: He has a most annoying way of being preoccupied &#x2014; or of busying himself with something else while people are talking with him, at him it becomes. Example, first couple of pages, Scene Two.<br><br>Stanley thinks Stella is very badly brought up. She can&#x2019;t do any of the ordinary things &#x2014; he had a girl before her who could really cook, but she drank an awful lot. Also she, Stella, has a lot of airs, most of which he&#x2019;s knocked out of her by now, but which still crop up. Emphasize Stanley&#x2019;s love for Stella. It is rough, embarrassed, and he rather truculently won&#x2019;t show it. But it is there. He&#x2019;s proud of her. When he&#x2019;s not on guard and looking at her, his eyes suddenly shine. He is grateful too, proud, satisfied. But he&#x2019;d never show it, demonstrate it.<br><br>As a character, Stanley is most interesting in his contradictions. His soft moments, his sudden pathetic little tough boy tenderness toward Stella. In Scene Three he cries like a baby. Somewhere in Scene Eight he almost makes it up with Blanche. In Scene Ten he does try to make it up with her&#x2014; and except for her doing the one thing that most arouses him, both in anger and sex, he might have.<br><br>The one thing that Stanley can&#x2019;t bear is someone who thinks that he or she is better than he is. His only way of explaining himself&#x2014; he thinks he stinks&#x2014; is that everyone else stinks. This is symbolic. True of our National State of Cynicism. No values. There is nothing to command his loyalty. Stanley rapes Blanche because he has tried and tried to keep her down to his level. This way is the last. For a moment he succeeds. And then in Scene Eleven, he has failed!<br><br>Excerpted from <b>Kazan on Directing </b>by Elia Kazan Copyright � 2009 by Frances Kazan.

"You'll attend our hanging, I assume."<br><br>"I'll give the executioner his orders, gladly." My voice became ice. It frightened me to hear it, to realize I was capable of such words.<br><br>Tenger smiled at my threat. "If you fail us, with similar enthusiasm we will execute your servant girl and driver. Only our methods are far more painful, I can promise you that. Now, what do you know about the Olden Blade?"<br><br>My gut twisted, but I tried not to let my worry show.

And who has the right to decide this ownership, particularly when the objects are sacred or, in the case of skeletal remains, human? Is it the museums that care for the objects or the communities whose ancestors made them? These questions are at the heart of <i>Plundered Skulls and Stolen Spirits</i>, an unflinching insider account by a leading curator who has spent years learning how to balance these controversial considerations.<br> <br> Five decades ago, Native American leaders launched a crusade to force museums to return their sacred objects and allow them to rebury their kin. Today, hundreds of tribes use the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act to help them recover their looted heritage from museums across the country. As senior curator of anthropology at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science, Chip Colwell has navigated firsthand the questions of how to weigh the religious freedom of Native Americans against the academic freedom of scientists and whether the emptying of museum shelves elevates human rights or destroys a common heritage. This book offers his personal account of the process of repatriation, following the trail of four objects as they were created, collected, and ultimately returned to their sources: a sculpture that is a living god, the scalp of a massacre victim, a ceremonial blanket, and a skeleton from a tribe considered by some to be extinct. These specific stories reveal a dramatic process that involves not merely obeying the law, but negotiating the blurry lines between identity and morality, spirituality and politics.<br> <br> Things, like people, have biographies. Repatriation, Colwell argues, is a difficult but vitally important way for museums and tribes to acknowledge that fact&#x2014;and heal the wounds of the past while creating a respectful approach to caring for these rich artifacts of history.<br> </p></p><p><b>Chip Colwell</b> is the senior curator of anthropology at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science. His work has been highlighted in such venues as&nbsp;the <i>New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>Denver Post</i>,&nbsp; <i>Huffington Post</i>, and&nbsp;C-SPAN, and his books include <i>Living Histories: Native Americans and Southwestern Archaeology </i>and <i>Inheriting the Past: The Making of Arthur C. Parker and Indigenous Archaeology</i>.<br> &nbsp;"This powerful book will be of particular importance to those working in museum and tribal settings, but is highly appropriate for anyone interested in cultural heritage and the legal efforts to manage claims for Native patrimony. Essential." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"<i>Plundered Skulls and Stolen Spirits</i>&nbsp;is a sobering peek into the controversy that surrounds tribal artifacts and human remains found in museums throughout the United States. His eloquent narration details several unique cases of repatriation. . . . Colwell has a unique perspective. He provides the reader with a firsthand look at the repatriation process, sympathetically including tribal perspectives--something that few museum directors have sought to do when writing on this subject in the past." (<i>Science</i>)<br><br><i>&#x201c;Plundered Skulls and Stolen Spirits </i>uses the story of one museum to show how Native American symbols of identity and ceremony and ancestral bones were initially appropriated as objects of cultural patrimony, but recently have become part of a complicated struggle of ownership. As Colwell profoundly shows, the emotional price paid by everyone involved&#x2014;Native American, archaeologist, and museum curator&#x2014;is never small.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (Larry J. Zimmerman, author of The Sacred Wisdom of the Native Americans)<br><br>"Colwell ably and sensitively tells the often conflict-ridden story of how and why museums in the US relinquished their hold over this material.&nbsp;. . . Colwell finds himself squarely in the middle of each quandary: a practising anthropologist who works alongside Native Americans every day and is sensitive to their cultural dynamics.

The message sounds loud and clear: Twenty-first century museums can indeed stand tall in addressing their own complex histories.

Over the decades, however, modern scholarship has shed new light on this tumultuous period, raising probing questions and providing new connections that have radically changed our understanding and outlook.</p><p>With this newly revised and updated edition of this essential work&#x2014;now including texts written by women as well as entries dealing with popular religion&#x2014;modern viewpoints are cogently addressed, while the scholarly integrity that has made this book a revered classic has been scrupulously maintained. Throughout, Hans J. Hillerbrand's basic assumption remains consistent: religion&#x2014;no matter how dependent on societal forces&#x2014;must be seen as the pivotal element in the story of the sixteenth century. </p></p><p>This collection of important primary sources pertaining to the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century has had an amazingly persistent history. Originally published some 40 years ago, it still enjoys the confidence of students of the Reformation. In contrast to most other source collections, The Protestant Reformation offered lengthy excerpts from important primary sources, rather than short snippets, so as to provide the reader with an understanding of the broader cogency and dynamic of an author&#39;s arguments. However, since the time of the original publication, the study of the Reformation of the sixteenth century has taken several important turns that have revised or changed the traditional understanding. Accordingly, these new perspectives need to be noted. This new edition seeks to accommodate these new trends and perspectives while retaining the basic orientation of the original edition. It includes texts written by women as well as texts dealing with popular religion. Its basic assumption, however, continues to be that religion - no matter how variously dependent on societal forces--must be seen as the pivotal element in the story of the sixteenth century.<p>Hans J. Hillerbrand is the former chair of the department of religion at Duke University. A recognized expert on the Reformation and the history of modern Christianity, he has published many articles and books on the period and was the editor in chief of <em>The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation</em>.

Now, he takes us inside a sphere utterly hostile to human life. He describes navigating the extreme challenge of long-term spaceflight, both life-threatening and mundane: the devastating effects on the body; the isolation from everyone he loves and the comforts of Earth; the catastrophic risks of colliding with space junk; and the still more haunting threat of being unable to help should tragedy strike at home--an agonizing situation Kelly faced when, on a previous mission, his twin brother's wife, American Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, was shot while he still had two months in space.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kelly's humanity, compassion, humor, and determination resonate throughout, as he recalls his rough-and-tumble New Jersey childhood and the youthful inspiration that sparked his astounding career, and as he makes clear his belief that Mars will be the next, ultimately challenging, step in spaceflight.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In <i>Endurance</i>, we see the triumph of the human imagination, the strength of the human will, and the infinite wonder of the galaxy.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of October 2017:</strong> Ask a child what they want to be when they grow up and one of the most popular responses is one that makes parents swoon: an astronaut. This hopeful enthusiasm wanes when their son or daughter starts bringing notes home from the teacher, complaining that they have the attention span of gnat, and need to stop parkouring on school property. Mums and dads, take heart. This description isn&#x2019;t far off from a young Scott Kelly, not the bookish type either, and yet it was a book he happened upon that dramatically changed the trajectory of his life: Tom Wolfe&#x2019;s <em>The Right Stuff</em>. Kelly was so inspired by this examination of the courageous test pilots who made high speed flight and space exploration possible that he was able to channel all of his frenetic energy into achieving the goal of becoming one. <em>Endurance</em> traces this journey, and chronicles the year Kelly spent on the International Space Station, as well as the effects it had on his body (information NASA needs as they plan a mission to Mars). Kelly answers many of the questions we have about life in space, from the profound to the mundane (turns out astronauts give bad haircuts and unclog toilets like the rest of us earthbound peeps). He also imparts the lessons and wisdom gleaned from his extraordinary adventures. Chief among them, and especially apropos given the increasingly divisive world we live in: &#x201c;Putting this space station into orbit...is the hardest thing that humans have ever done, and it stands as proof that when we set our minds to something hard, when we work together, we can do anything, including solving our problems here on Earth.&#x201d; <em>Endurance</em> is a fascinating, moving, uplifting read. <em>--Erin Kodicek, Amazon Book Review</em><b>SCOTT KELLY</b> is a former military fighter pilot and test pilot, an engineer, a retired astronaut, and a retired U.S. Navy captain.

Yet in backyards and on rooftops all over the world, bees are being raised successfully, even without antibiotics, miticides, or other chemical inputs.More and more organically minded beekeepers are now using top-bar hives, in which the shape of the interior resembles a hollow log. Long lasting and completely biodegradable, a topbar hive made of untreated wood allows bees to build comb naturally rather than simply filling prefabricated foundation frames in a typical box hive with added supers.</p> <p>Top-bar hives yield slightly less honey but produce more beeswax than a typical Langstroth box hive. Regular hive inspection and the removal of old combs helps to keep bees healthier and naturally disease-free.</p> <p><em>Top-Bar Beekeeping</em> provides complete information on hive management and other aspects of using these innovative hives. All home and hobbyist beekeepers who have the time and interest in keeping bees intensively should consider the natural, low-stress methods outlined in this book. It will also appeal to home orchardists, gardeners, and permaculture practitioners who look to bees for pollination as well as honey or beeswax.</p></p><p>Les Crowder has devoted his entire adult life to the study and care of honeybees. Dedicated to finding organic and natural solutions for problems commonly treated with chemicals, he designed his own top-bar hives and set about discovering how to treat disease and genetic weaknesses through plant medicine and selective breeding. He has been a leader in his community, having served as New Mexico's honeybee inspector and president of the New Mexico Beekeepers Association. He is an avid storyteller and has spoken annually at the NM Organic Farm Conference for over fifteen years. Les is also a certified teacher and enjoys teaching children Spanish and science.<br><br>Heather Harrell moved to New Mexico in 1996 from her home state of Vermont to pursue her masters degree in Eastern Classics, having long had an interest in the art of meditation and yoga and a yearning to pursue a career in academia. Her love of nature soon had her pursuing a life as an organic farmer, focusing on flowers, then medicinal herbs. Over time, and through her work with honeybees, she has moved her focus to the study of multi-use permaculture plantings, which support a diverse network of interrelationships in the natural world. Along with a wide variety of vegetables, she grows medicinal herbs, which offer nectar and pollen to pollinator species. She is very interested in how soil biology is affected by using biodynamic methods of planting, and is currently studying compost teas incorporating various types of manures and plant materials.<p><em><strong> ForeWord Reviews-</strong></em><br><br>"Farmers who seek a guide to hive maintenance told through a thoughtful personal narrative will benefit from the discussion of this topbar style of beekeeping. The first-person style of the book allows a window into the practices of the topbar beekeeper while conveying a wealth of knowledge and a well-researched comparison of hive practices. The book is appropriate for beginning beekeepers as well as those experienced but looking for information on natural and organic beekeeping practices. The book&#x2019;s ten sections discuss optimal practices of an organic beekeeper juxtaposed with discussion of industry standard practices and their drawbacks. Each section contains stories of the authors&#x2019; successes and failures as well as diagrams and pictures to explain everything from hive design to plant species for optimal pollination. Whether the reader is looking to start their own hive or simply increase their knowledge of honeybees, the book provides interesting and detailed discussions of all aspects of raising them. Crowder and Harrell offer not only advice on how to get started, but an in-depth discussion of all aspects of keeping a hive, from bee capture, breeding, and selection to honey processing. They have crafted a book that is both informative and engaging, filled with introspective advice and practical knowledge."</p><br><br><p><em><strong> Publisher's Weekly-</strong></em><br><br>"Cave drawings show beekeepers &#x201c;smoking&#x201d; their hives, preparing for insect interaction. Today&#x2019;s mass-produced honey relies mostly on the venerable Langstroth method of beekeeping, which has produced plenty of honey&#x2015;but also has introduced plenty of chemicals into the process&#x2015;through the years. Top-bar hives, named for the bars that run across their tops, are popular with bee beginners even though they produce less honey than Langstroth hives. But this account, the culmination of Crowder and Harrell&#x2019;s 40 years of top-bar beekeeping adventures, shows the reader their method&#x2019;s advantages: it avoids antibiotics, miticides, and other chemicals inherent to the conventional process. Crowder and his wife, Harrell, leave no comb unharvested as they take the top-bar aspirant from bee basics (stings, smoke, and hive transfers) through hive management (comb removal and feeding) to beneficial, and profitable, byproducts like beeswax. For those a bit lukewarm to the swarm, the book gives a fascinating insight into bees&#x2019; elaborate organizational and geometry skills, and it may even make one reconsider buying mass-marketed, chemical-laced honey."</p><br><br><p>"Reading <em>Top-Bar Beekeeping</em> reminds me of the classes I took with Les Crowder several years ago. He's a man who truly knows whereof he speaks, who has the gift of communicating with his small friends, the bees, and sharing his understanding with us. . . . This is the one book on beekeeping that I will recommend to my permaculture students."<strong>--Scott Pittman, Director, Permaculture Institute USA</strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"This is an excellent guide for hobby beekeepers who wish to keep bees using top-bar hives. Drawing on his more than 30 years of beekeeping experience in New Mexico, author Les Crowder describes in detail the special comb management techniques that this low-cost, but relatively intensive, form of beekeeping requires. <em>Top-Bar Beekeeping</em> also provides an eloquent appeal for beekeepers to make care, respect, and reverence the foundation of their relationships with the bees."<strong>--Thomas D. Seeley, Cornell University; author of <em>Honeybee Democracy</em> and <em>The Wisdom of the Hive</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"This book presents practical advice, gained from first-hand experience, on the organic management of top bar hives. This book will serve as an excellent guide to the ever-growing number of beekeepers that utilizes less intrusive management schemes such as top bar hives. Thanks to Les and Heather for their efforts to provide sound advice on natural ways to keep bees."<strong>--Dr. Jeff Pettis, USDA-ARS</strong><br> <br> </p></p><h2>Valhalla Rising (Dirk Pitt)</h2><p><p><b>Marine explorer Dirk Pitt must rely on the nautical lore of Jules Verne to stop a ruthless oil baron with his sights set on political power in this #1 <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling series.</b><br><br>In the middle of its maiden voyage, a luxury cruise ship using revolutionary new engines suddenly catches fire and sinks.

Pitt's NUMA survey ship happens to be in the vicinity when the world's newest and biggest cruise ship founders and sinks, giving Pitt the chance to stage the daring rescue of nearly 2,000 passengers. Among those who perish is a famous scientist whose revolutionary engines powered the ship to her watery grave; while Pitt is unable to save Dr. Egan, he rescues his beautiful daughter Kelly from the sea, and later from a murder attempt aboard the rescue vessel.<p> Pitt and his trusty pal Al Giordino track the sinking to the boardroom door of a multinational conglomerate called Cerberus, whose evil CEO has designs on the world's oil supply. He'll do anything to keep Egan's advanced engines and secret formula for frictionless oil off the market--even sabotage another vessel, this time a luxury passenger submarine. By the time our heroes have foiled the mastermind's nefarious plots, they've also uncovered the existence of a working submarine nearly a century before one actually existed--irrefutable proof of a Viking landing on the Hudson River--and the remains of the British sailor who inspired Jules Verne's Captain Nemo.

Inspired by Raymond Queneau&#x2019;s 1947 <b>Exercises in Style</b>, a mainstay of creative writing courses, Madden&#x2019;s project demonstrates the expansive range of possibilities available to all storytellers. Readers are taken on an enlightening tour&#x2014;sometimes amusing, always surprising&#x2014;through the world of the story.<p>Writers and artists in every media will find Madden&#x2019;s collection especially useful, even revelatory. Here is a chance to see the full scope of opportunities available to the storyteller, each applied to a single scenario: varying points of view, visual and verbal parodies, formal reimaginings, and radical shuffling of the basic components of the story. Madden&#x2019;s amazing series of approaches will inspire storytellers to think through and around obstacles that might otherwise prevent them from getting good ideas onto the page. 99 Ways to Tell a Story provides a model that will spark productive conversations among all types of creative people: novelists, screenwriters, graphic designers, and cartoonists.</p></p><p>Matt Madden started self-publishing minicomics in the early 1990s. He published his first graphic novel, <b>Black Candy</b> (Black Eye Books), in 1998, and in 2001 published <b>Odds Off</b> (Highwater Books). Madden lives in Brooklyn with his wife, author and cartoonist Jessica Abel. He works in comics and illustration; he also teaches comics at the School of Visual Arts and Yale University. His latest work appears in <b>A Fine Mess</b>, his biannual series published by Alternative Comics.<i>Starred Review.</i> Retelling the same one-page comic 99 different ways sounds boring, but Madden, a leading proponent of the value of formalist exercises, demonstrates how well boundaries can drive creativity, inspired by the similar work of Raymond Queneau. A new discovery awaits the reader on every page. The basic scene is a nonstory about a man who forgets why he's looking in the refrigerator. In the variations, new elements are introduced and removed: different characters, more panels, fewer closeups, flashbacks, text-only or a focus on sound or color effects. Madden acknowledges the history of the medium with allusions to various genres and characters (including the Yellow Kid, Krazy Kat and Winsor McCay's Rarebit Fiend). Favorites include a how-to on building a comic, a palindromic story that reads the same backward and forward, and a calligram (with text formed into a question mark shape). The book's format is ideal, with each page of comics facing a small identifying label, so approaches don't compete with each other, yet pages placed in sequence add up to another narrative. Anyone interested in comics or storytelling will learn much about the interaction between format and content through comparison of Madden's many ingenious approaches. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hollinger (PhD, Drew University) is president and Colman M. Mockler Distinguished Professor of Christian Ethics at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in South Hamilton, Massachusetts. He is the coeditor of the Critical Issues in Bioethics series.This is an introduction to ethics written from a Christian perspective and directed to a Christian audience. While recognizing the importance of the Bible as a determinant of ethical principles, Hollinger (Messiah Coll.; Individualism and Ethics) also recognizes that we live in a human, fallen, complex world. Arguing that any ethics must be grounded in a particular community and develop out of that community's worldview, Hollinger ably describes the foundations of Christian ethics and the role of ethics in a postmodern world, which he sees as socially fragmented and thus unable to engage in significant moral discourse. In a volume based more on principles than particulars, he argues for a balance between love and justice. An excellent introduction to ethics, the book offers a good balance between explaining what ethics is and providing an approach to dealing with ethical issues in a pluralistic society. Intended as a textbook for Christian seminaries and colleges, it will nevertheless appeal to anyone interested in the role of ethics in contemporary society. Highly recommended, especially for church and seminary libraries.<br><i>Augustine J.

Yet there is no recent British publication in this field. That is why this accessible, wide-ranging introduction is so valuable. It offers a clear and practical way into the subject, explaining the scientific discoveries and techniques and illustrating with case studies how it can be used by genealogists to gain an insight into their ancestry.<br><br>The subject is complex and perhaps difficult for traditional genealogists to understand but, with the aid of this book, novices who are keen to take advantage of it will be able to interpret test results and use them to help answer genealogical questions which cannot be answered by documentary evidence alone. It will also appeal to those with some experience in the field because it places the practical application of genetic genealogy within a wider context, highlighting its role as a genealogical tool and suggesting how it can be made more effective.</p><p>Graham S.

While it remains a fundamental work on chess strategy, the way chess positions are handled has changed greatly since Nimzowitsch's time - both refinements to existing ideas, and completely new concepts. John Watson's book fulfils the need for a thorough, profound work on the modern handling of chess positions, and how Nimzowitsch's theories - still controversial and revolutionary at the time My System was written - have been refined and used alongside classical concepts.<br> <br>The first section of the book discusses how the understanding of classical themes, such as pawn majorities, the centre, and structural weaknesses, have been refined. Watson then moves on to discuss new concepts, including the willingness of modern players to accept backward pawns in return for dynamic play, the idea of a good 'bad' bishop, knights finding useful roles at the edge of the board and the exchange sacrifice idea that became prevalent with the post-war Soviet champions. This profound yet thoroughly practical work is rounded off with sections on prophylactic thinking, dynamism, modern concepts as they apply to the critical contemporary opening systems, and some thoughts on the future of chess.<br> <br></p><p><br>International Master John Watson is one of the world's most respected writers on chess.

After losing his hand in an accident, Andy Catlett confronts an agronomist whose surreal vision can see only industrial farming. This vision is powerfully contrasted with that of modest Amish farmers content to live outside the pressures brought by capitalist postindustrial <i>progress</i>, and by working the land to keep &#x201c;away the three great evils, boredom, vice, and need.&#x201d;</b></p> <p>As Andy's perspective filters through his anger over his loss and the harsh city of San Francisco surrounding him, he begins to remember: the people and places that wait 2,000 miles away in his Kentucky home, the comfort he knew as a farmer, and his symbiotic relationship to the soil. Andy laments the modern shift away from the love of the land, even as he begins to accept his own changed relationship to the world. Wendell Berry's continued fascination with the power of memory continues in this treasured novel set in 1976.</p></p><p>A native Kentuckian, Wendell Berry lived and taught in New York and California before returning permanently to the Kentucky River region, where he farms on 125 acres in Henry County.Andy Catlett&#39;s right hand has been cut off by a corn-picking machine. &#34;Detached&#34; might be a better description since the accident sends Andy into a state of general detachment and malaise. He travels to San Francisco to speak at a meeting of agricultural experts and as he roams the city streets at night, his missing hand becomes a portal into all things missing--love, descendants, and even the family farms that are being replaced by agribusiness. (The book is set in 1976.) There&#39;s a spirituality hovering over the proceedings and, like Andy&#39;s missing hand, it permeates everything without making itself seen. The audiobook&#39;s power has a lot to do with Michael Kramer&#39;s narration. Kramer reads as if he were painting, applying sentences like minimalist brush strokes.

Unaccountably, the details of that shocking crime have been largely ignored by Wright&#x2019;s legion of biographers&#x2014;a historical and cultural gap that is finally addressed in William Drennan&#x2019;s exhaustively researched <i>Death in a Prairie House: Frank Lloyd Wright and the Taliesin Murders.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to the scandal generated by his open affair with the proto-feminist and free love advocate Mamah Borthwick Cheney, Wright had begun to build Taliesin as a refuge and "love cottage" for himself and his mistress (both married at the time to others).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conceived as the apotheosis of Wright&#x2019;s prairie house style, the original Taliesin would stand in all its isolated glory for only a few months before the bloody slayings that rocked the nation and reduced the structure itself to a smoking hull.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplying both a gripping mystery story and an authoritative portrait of the artist as a young man, Drennan wades through the myths surrounding Wright and the massacre, casting fresh light on the formulation of Wright&#x2019;s architectural ideology and the cataclysmic effects that the Taliesin murders exerted on the fabled architect and on his subsequent designs.William R.

There were days on which nothing of any consequence took place&#x2014;these were in a clear majority&#x2014;and then there were those on which rather too much happened. On those uneventful days you might well wish that a bit more would happen; on days when too much occurred, you longed for life to become a bit quieter.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had always been like that, she thought, and always would be. As her father, the late Obed Ramotswe, often said: there are always too many cattle or too few&#x2014;never just the right number. As a child she had wondered what he meant by this; now she knew.<br> &nbsp;<br> Both sorts of day started in much the same way, with the opening of her eyes to the familiar dappled pattern made by the morning sun on the ceiling above her bed, an indistinct dancing of light, faint at first, but gradually becoming stronger. This intrusion of the dawn came from the gap between the curtains&#x2014;the gap that she always intended to do something about, but did not because there were more pressing domestic tasks and never enough time for everything you had to do. And as long as curtains did their main job, which was to prevent nosy people&#x2014;<i>unauthorised people, </i>as Mma&nbsp;Makutsi would call them&#x2014;from looking into her bedroom without her permission, then she did not have to worry too much about their not meeting in the middle.<br> &nbsp;<br> She woke up at more or less the same time each morning, thought for a while about getting up, and then rose, leaving Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni still deeply asleep on his side of the bed, dreaming about the sort of things that mechanics, and men in general, dream about. Women, she felt, should not enquire too closely as to what these things were, as they were not the sort of things that women liked very much&#x2014;engines and football, and so on. A friend had once said to her that men did not dream about things like that&#x2014;that this was just what women <i>wanted</i> men to dream about, while men, in reality, dreamed about things that they would never reveal. Mma Ramotswe doubted this. She had asked Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni one morning what he had dreamed about and he had replied: &#x201c;the garage,&#x201d; and if this were not proof enough, on another occasion, when she had woken him from the tossing and turning of a nightmare, he had replied to her question about the content of the bad dream by saying that it had all been to do with a seized-up gearbox. And then there was Puso, their foster child, who had told her that his dreams were about having a large dog that chased away the bullies at school, or about finding an old aeroplane in the back yard and fixing it so that it could fly, or about scoring a goal for Botswana in a soccer match against Zambia, with the whole stadium rising to its feet and cheering him. That, she thought, settled that. Perhaps there were some men who dreamed about other things, but she felt that this was not the case for most men.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once up and about, clasping her cup of freshly brewed red bush tea in her hand, she took a walk around the garden, savouring the freshness of the early morning air. Some people said that the air in the morning had no smell; she thought they were wrong, for it smelled of so many things&#x2014;of the acacia leaves that had been closed for the night and were now opening at the first touch of the morning sun; of a wood fire somewhere, just a hint of it; of the wind, and the breath that the wind had, which was dry and sweet, like the breath of cattle. It was while she was standing there that she decided whether the day would be one in which things might happen; it had something to do with the way she felt when she considered the day ahead. And most of the time she was right, although sometimes, of course, she could be completely wrong.<br> &nbsp;<br> On that particular morning as she walked past the mopipi tree she had planted at the front of the garden, she had a sudden feeling that the next few hours were going to be rather unusual. It was not a disturbing premonition&#x2014;not one of those feelings that one gets when one fears that something is going to go badly wrong&#x2014;it was more a feeling that something interesting and out of the ordinary lay ahead.<br> &nbsp;<br> She remarked on the fact to Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni as he sat at the kitchen table eating the brown maize porridge that he liked so much. Puso and his sister, Motholeli, had already eaten their breakfast and were in their rooms preparing to leave for school. The school run that Mma Ramotswe had become so used to was now no longer necessary, as Puso was of an age to make his own way there&#x2014;the school was not far away&#x2014;and he was also able to help his sister with the wheelchair. This gave the children an independence that they both enjoyed, although departing on time could be a problem when Puso had some boyish task to complete&#x2014;the catching of flying ants, for instance&#x2014;or Motholeli had at the last minute to find another pair of cotton socks or locate a book that needed to be returned to the school library.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have a feeling,&#x201d; announced Mma Ramotswe, &#x201c;that this is going to be a busy day.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni glanced up from his porridge. &#x201c;Lots of letters to write? Bills to send out?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma Ramotswe shook her head. &#x201c;No, we&#x2019;re up to date on all of those things, Rra. Mma&nbsp;Makutsi has been busy with her filing, too, and everything is put away.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lots of clients to see, then?&#x201d; He thought of his own day and imagined a line of driverless, impatient cars, each eager for his attention, their horns honking to attract his notice: cars, in his view, were quite capable of all the human emotions and failings, including a lack of patience or restraint.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma Ramotswe had looked at her diary just before leaving the office the previous day and had seen that it was largely empty. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;There are no appointments with clients. Nothing this morning and nothing this afternoon, I think.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He looked puzzled. &#x201c;And yet it&#x2019;s going to be a busy day?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have that feeling. It&#x2019;s difficult to say why, but I am sure that this will not be a quiet day.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni smiled. People talked about the intuition of women, but he was not sure that he believed in it. How could women possibly know things that men did not know? Was their hearing more acute than men&#x2019;s, so that they heard things that men missed&#x2014;as dogs or cats might pick up frequencies audible only to them? He thought not. Or was their eyesight more acute, so that they saw clear details where men saw only indistinct blurs? Again, he thought not. What we knew, we knew from our senses, and the senses of women were no different from the senses of men.<br> &nbsp;<br> And yet, and yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As he returned to his porridge, Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni reflected on how there had been so many instances in which Mma Ramotswe had shown a quite uncanny ability to notice things that he himself had simply missed, or to know things about others that most people&#x2014;most ordinary people, or men, to be specific&#x2014;would not be expected to know. He remembered how, while out shopping with her a few weeks earlier, she had whispered to him that a woman walking towards them was probably one of Mma&nbsp;Potokwane&#x2019;s cousins. He had cast an eye discreetly over the woman and wondered whether he had ever met her in the company of Mma&nbsp;Potokwane, but decided that he had not. How, then, could Mma Ramotswe tell?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She was carrying one of those bags that the orphans make in Mma&nbsp;Potokwane&#x2019;s craft workshop,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the first thing I noticed. Then I saw the shoes that she was wearing. They were very unusual shoes, and I had seen them before&#x2014;when they belonged to Mma&nbsp;Potokwane. She must have passed them on.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He had dismissed this as fanciful, but several days later, when he had gone out to the Orphan Farm to attend to one of the vans, on a pro bono basis of course, he had remembered the incident and asked Mma&nbsp; Potokwane whether she had any cousins visiting her. She did. And had she passed on an unusual pair of shoes to this cousin? &#x201c;As it happens,&#x201d; said Mma&nbsp; Potokwane, &#x201c;I did. But let&#x2019;s not waste time talking about these small things, Rra. Now there is something wrong with the spare van too, and I was hoping that you would have the time to look at that one as well.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He had sighed. &#x201c;I am always happy to help you, Mma&nbsp; Potokwane,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But there are places called garages, you know, and they are there to fix vehicles. That is their job. Perhaps you might try in future to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma&nbsp; Potokwane did not let him finish. &#x201c;Oh, I know all about garages,&#x201d; she said lightly. &#x201c;But I would never go to one of them&#x2014;your own garage excluded, of course, Rra. Ow, those garages are expensive! You drive onto their forecourt and straightaway that&#x2019;s two hundred pula. You get out of the car&#x2014;that&#x2019;s another fifty pula. They say, &#x2018;Good morning, Mma, and what can we do for you?&#x2019; That costs seventy-five pula to say, and so it goes on. No, Rra, I will not go near those places; not me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, as he finished the last of his porridge, Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni reminded himself that the one thing he felt certain about when it came to women was that you could never be sure. If Mma Ramotswe said she had a feeling about something, then it was perfectly possible that her instinct was correct. So rather than say, &#x201c;We shall see, Mma,&#x201d; he muttered, &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re probably right, Mma.&#x201d; And then he added, very much as an afterthought&#x2014;and a hesitant afterthought at that&#x2014;&#x201c;Who knows, Mma, what will happen? Who knows?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> When Mma Ramotswe arrived at the office that morning, Mma&nbsp;Makutsi was already there. Grace Makutsi, wife of Mr.&nbsp;Phuti Radiphuti and mother of Itumelang Clovis Radiphuti, had recently been made a full partner in the business. It had been a long road, one that stretched from her first appointment as secretary in the fledgling agency, to assistant detective, to the vague, rather unsatisfactory status of associate detective, and finally to partnership. It had been a road that started in distant Bobonong, in the north of the country, in a home that housed six people in two cramped rooms, and from there had led, through much scrimping and saving by Mma&nbsp;Makutsi&#x2019;s family, to the Botswana Secretarial College. At the end of her course the road had climbed sharply uphill to the glorious mark of ninety-seven per cent in the final examinations&#x2014;a result never before achieved at the college, and never since then equalled. But even that distinction provided in itself no guarantee of a life free of struggle, and for some years Mma&nbsp;Makutsi had been obliged to endure an existence of parsimony and want. Mma Ramotswe would have paid her more had she been able, but the No.&nbsp;1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency made no money at all, and there was a limit to how generous a loss-making business could be. There would have been no point, she thought, in giving Mma&nbsp;Makutsi a bigger salary and then having to close the business down after a month or two when it went bankrupt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma&nbsp;Makutsi understood all this. She was grateful to Mma Ramotswe for all she did for her, and so when her fortunes changed dramatically on her marriage to Mr.&nbsp;Phuti Radiphuti, she made it clear that she would not give up her job, but would continue to work at the No.&nbsp;1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency. As a partner in the business, her devotion to the enterprise became even more intense&#x2014;hence her new habit of arriving earlier than Mma Ramotswe on most mornings.<br> &nbsp;<br> To begin with, her baby son, Itumelang, accompanied his mother into the office, sleeping contentedly in his carrycot while she got on with her work. Now, however, he had become more wakeful, and consequently more demanding, and this meant that he was left at home with the woman from Bobonong who had been employed as a nursemaid.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am very happy with my life,&#x201d; said Mma&nbsp;Makutsi. &#x201c;I find professional satisfaction in my work, and at the same time I have all the pleasure of running a home. It is a very good thing when a woman can do both of these things.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, we women are doing very well in Botswana,&#x201d; agreed Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have to sit out in the lands all day. We are running businesses now. We are building roads. We are flying aeroplanes. We are doing all the things that men used to think were not for us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> For a moment, Mma&nbsp;Makutsi pictured Mma Ramotswe at the controls of a plane. It would be hard for her to keep the aircraft level, she thought, as her traditional build would make it far heavier on the side on which she was sitting. It would be possible, she felt, to adjust the controls so that the wing on her side came up a bit, but she still imagined that landings would be a bit heavy, and bumpy. Of course it would be quite a shock if one were to get into a plane and see that Mma Ramotswe was in the pilot&#x2019;s seat. It would be rude to refuse to board the plane in such circumstances, and one would simply have to put a brave face on it and hope for the best. Perhaps one could hide one&#x2019;s surprise by saying something like, &#x201c;Oh, Mma Ramotswe, I did not know that you had taken up flying. This is good news, Mma. This is a big victory for women.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Coming into the office first, Mma&nbsp;Makutsi took it upon herself to have the early morning cup of tea&#x2014;as distinct from the mid-morning and late morning cups&#x2014;ready for when Mma Ramotswe arrived. This cup was an important one, as it enabled the two women to consider their plans for the day ahead. There might have been no scientific connection between drinking tea and getting one&#x2019;s thoughts in order, but that was the way it seemed, at least in Mma Ramotswe&#x2019;s opinion. Tea brought about focus, and that helped.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;What have we today, Mma&nbsp;Makutsi?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have tea to begin with,&#x201d; said Mma&nbsp;Makutsi.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That is very good.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, we have nothing, as far as I can see, Mma.&#x201d; Mma&nbsp;Makutsi paused. &#x201c;Unless, of course, something turns up. And it might. Sometimes there is nothing at eight o&#x2019;clock and then at ten o&#x2019;clock there is something.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have a feeling there&#x2019;ll be something,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;When I was in my garden this morning I had a feeling about that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma&nbsp;Makutsi, looking down at the surface of her desk, moved a pencil from one place to another. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said pensively. &#x201c;There might be something. Later on.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You think so, Mma?&#x201d; asked Mma Ramotswe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma&nbsp;Makutsi waited some time before answering. Then at last she said, &#x201c;I am expecting some news, Mma. It might come today.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma Ramotswe knew better than to ask exactly what this news might be. Mma&nbsp;Makutsi sometime...</p><h2>The Family Next Door: The Heartbreaking Imprisonment of the Thirteen Turpin Siblings and Their Extraordinary Rescue</h2><p><p><b>From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling true crime author John Glatt comes the devastating story of the Turpins: a seemingly normal family whose dark secrets would shock and captivate the world. </b></p><p>On January 14, 2018, a seventeen-year-old girl climbed out of the window of her Perris, California home and dialed 911 on a borrowed cell phone.

The gift is a perfect example of what Mauss calls a total social phenomenon, since it involves legal, economic, moral, religious, aesthetic, and other dimensions. He sees the gift exchange as related to individuals and groups as much as to the objects themselves, and his analysis calls into question the social conventions and economic systems that had been taken for granted for so many years.

However, the practice of the Law of Attraction as it is currently taught yields disappointing -- or even harmful -- results. &#34;The Greatest Manifestation Principle in the World&#34; corrects the inaccuracies, points out hidden dangers, and dispels the myths surrounding the Law of Attraction. More importantly, it sheds light on *the most powerful manifestation principle* that no one is talking about. When you combine this principle with your practice of the Law of Attraction, you enter the realm of miracles where your desires can and MUST necessarily manifest into existence.

He tells the intriguing story of St. Thomas who - by taking a vow of poverty and joining the Dominicans - defied his illustrious, prominent family&#39;s ambition for him to have great power in the Church. The battles and Crusades of the 13th century and the ruthlessness of the excommunicated Emperor Frederick II play a big part in the story, but it is Thomas of Aquino who dominates this book. De Wohl succeeds notably in portraying the exceptional quality of this man, a fusion of mighty intellect and childlike simplicity. A pupil of St. Albert the Great, the humble Thomas - through an intense life of study, writing, prayer, preaching and contemplation - ironically rose to become the influential figure of his age, and he later was proclaimed by the Church as the Angelic Doctor.</p><p>Louis de Wohl wrote numerous historical novels for adults, including &#34;The Living Wood&#34;, which is also about St. Helena and Constantine. He earned international acclaim for The Spear, and among his other popular titles are &#34;Lay Siege to Heaven, The Restless Flame, The Joyful Beggar &#34;and &#34;The Quiet Light.&#34;</p><h2>The Literacy Teacher&#39;s Playbook, Grades 3-6: Four Steps for Turning Assessment Data into Goal-Directed Instruction</h2><p><p><em>This book is about being empowered by assessment, not bogged down by it.</em><br> <strong>Jennifer Serravallo</strong></p> <p>"The aim of <em>The Literacy Teacher's Playbook,</em>" writes Jennifer Serravallo, "is to help you collect data that is helpful, analyze the data correctly, and make plans based on that data."</p> <p>National and state standards set learning goals, and it's up to you to help each student find his or her path to meeting them.

Dossey&#x2019;s premise is that all individual minds are part of an infinite, collective dimension of consciousness he calls the One Mind. This state&#x2014;which we can all access&#x2014;explains phenomena as diverse as epiphanies, creative breakthroughs, premonitions of danger or disaster, near-death experiences, communication with other species and with the dead, reincarnation, the movement of herds, flocks, and schools, and remote healing.Dossey presents his theory in easily digestible, bite-sized vignettes. Through engaging stories, fascinating research, and brilliant insights from great thinkers throughout history, readers will explore the outer reaches of human consciousness, discover a new way to interpret the great mysteries of our experience, and learn how to develop the empathy necessary to engender more love, peace, and collective awareness. The result is a rich new understanding of what it means to be human and a renewed hope that we can successfully confront the challenges we face at this crossroads in human history.Even before publication One Mind drew praise from the finest minds of our time. It has been heralded as "landmark," "a brilliant synthesis," a "magnum opus," a "feast" of ideas, "compelling," "gripping," and "a major shift in our understanding of consciousness."</p><p>Larry Dossey, M.D., is a leader in bringing scientific understanding to spirituality, and rigorous proof to complementary/integrative medicine.

There was talk of seeing a marriage counselor. Bart was distraught; Jenn seemed disenchanted. She needed to reach out to someone she could confide in&#x2014;beyond her mother and her sisters. Then, just a few weeks before Christmas 2004, Jenn was found dead with a bullet in her head, a revolver beside her. From the position of the body her death appeared to be a suicide. But Gwinnett County detective Marcus Head was not totally convinced, nor was Jenn's family, who could not believe she would take her own life.<br> <br>And how was this death related to another apparent suicide fourteen years earlier&#x2014;that of Dorothy "Dolly" Hearn, a spectacularly beautiful dental student? A star athlete and homecoming queen in high school, Dolly later dated Bart Corbin in dental school. Was there a connection, or was the answer to be found in a secret&#x2014;even dangerous&#x2014;relationship Jenn Corbin was having outside her marriage? For <i>T</i><i>oo Late to Say Goodbye,</i> Ann Rule has interviewed virtually everyone in any way related to the story&#x2014;the victims' families, police investigators, prosecutors, and sources from Georgia to Australia&#x2014;to uncover the truth behind the headlines of these two sensational deaths. What emerges is an incredible tale of jealous rage; of stunning circumstantial and physical evidence that runs from the steamy to the macabre to almost-unheard-of forensic techniques; and of a tragic irony&#x2014;a fateful discovery that motivated the killing. The definitive unraveling of one of the strangest murder investigations of our time, <i>Too Late to Say Goodbye</i> is perhaps the finest achievement of a truly great writer's career.</p><p>Ann Rule wrote thirty-five&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, all of them still in print. Her first bestseller was&nbsp;<i>The Stranger Beside Me</i>, about her personal relationship with infamous serial killer Ted Bundy. A former Seattle police officer, she used her firsthand expertise in all her books. For more than three decades, she was a powerful advocate for victims of violent crime. She lived near Seattle and died in 2015.<b>Chapter One</b><p>December 4, 2004</p><p></p><p>The shriek of sirens piercing the chill December morning on Bogan Gates Drive was almost as alien as the thackety-thackety of helicopters overhead would be. This quiet street in Buford is a relatively new part of an upscale neighborhood, home to young and middle-aged professionals and their families. The houses here have mostly red-brick fa�ades with glossy black shutters, not unlike homes in Atlanta's more affluent districts, but on a smaller scale. In 2004, the average price of a home in Bogan Gates was between $200,000 and $300,000 -- the homes would cost twice that in Denver or Seattle or Philadelphia. Buford is an ideal suburb for those who commute the thirty-five miles to Atlanta: large enough with over 14,000 residents to merit local shopping centers, but small enough to dissolve the tension that comes with driving the I-285 beltway that encircles Atlanta with bumper-to-bumper traffic. And Bogan Gates Drive itself is an oasis of serenity with its manicured lawns and colorful gardens. Children play under the watchful eyes of all the adults there. If some stranger should insinuate himself into this enclave, he would not go unnoticed.</p><p>A negative note, at least for some, is that close neighbors tend to know each other's secrets. There isn't the anonymity that exists in apartment buildings in large cities. Neither is there the loneliness that city dwellers sometimes feel. Even so, some families on the street have secrets that none of their neighbors could possibly imagine.</p><p>That doesn't stamp Bogan Gates as different; every community has its mysteries and even its surprising secrets. When reporters for television news and local papers sweep into such places, they are certain to obtain instant interviews with shocked residents who invariably say: "Something like that just doesn't happen here -- not in our neighborhood!"</p><p>But, of course, it does.</p><p>On this day in early December, Bogan Gates Drive just happened to be the site of one of the most horrific crimes in Georgia.</p><p>The town of Buford, its name as Southern as a name can be, sits close to Lake Lanier. This popular vacation spot's waters meander for mile after mile, cutting channels deep and wide into the shoreline, leaving inlets that resemble the bite marks of a giant alligator. Buford is surrounded by other small townships: Flowery Branch, Sugar Hill, Suwanee, Duluth, Oakville, Alpharetta. It is very close to the border between Gwinnett and Forsyth counties. Forsyth County once had a reputation as one of the most racially prejudiced areas in America. A sign beside the road there could read "Boiled Peanuts," or it might say, "Nigger, Get Out of Forsyth County, Before Sunset." But no longer. Oprah Winfrey once broadcast her show from Forsyth County, pulling aside the blinds to reveal raw prejudice. Today, those with set ideas about racial disparities have learned not to voice them aloud.</p><p>Buford, in Gwinnett County, is far more in tune with the twenty-first century, a bedroom community tied to a thriving metropolis. Young families who live there can enjoy relatively small-town warmth, or drive to Atlanta for more cosmopolitan pleasures.</p><p>The family who lived at 4515 Bogan Gates Drive fit comfortably into Buford's demographics. Dr. Barton T. Corbin, forty, had recently moved his dental practice to Hamilton Mill -- less than ten miles away. His wife, Jennifer "Jenn" Corbin, taught at a preschool in the Sugar Hill Methodist Church. Although Dr. Corbin's efforts to build a new practice often kept him away from home, and Jenn was the parent who spent more time with their children, they both seemed to dote on their sons, Dalton, seven, and Dillon, five. They went to the boys' ballgames and participated in school events at Harmony Elementary School, where Dalton was in second grade and Dillon in kindergarten.</p><p>Married almost nine years, the Corbins appeared to have all those things that most young couples long for: healthy children, a lovely home, admired professions, close family ties, and myriad friends.</p><p>Jenn Corbin, thirty-three, was tall and pretty, a big-boned blond who usually had a smile on her face, no matter what worries might lie behind it. Bart was also tall, taller than Jenn by two or three inches, but beyond that he was her opposite. His hair was almost black, his eyes even darker, his pale skin surprisingly dotted with freckles. He was a "gym rat" whose muscular physique showed the results of his predawn workouts. When Bart was dealing with a problem, however, or worrying over his finances, he lost weight rapidly and became angular and bony. Then his cheekbones protruded and his profile turned sharp as an ax, almost Lincolnesque.</p><p>Many of his female patients found Bart strikingly handsome; some others were a little put off by his intensity. But most of Bart Corbin's patients seemed to like him. He often traded dental care with his personal friends for some service he needed, using an old-fashioned barter system.</p><p>To an outsider, the Corbins' marriage appeared solid -- her sunniness balancing his sometimes dark moods. In truth, tiny threadlike fissures had crept silently through the perceived foundation of their marriage, weakening its structure from the inside out until a single blow could send it crumbling.</p><p>Most people who knew the Corbins weren't aware that Jenn had fled their home shortly after Thanksgiving of 2004, and that a divorce might be forthcoming. Those who did know were shaken that "Bart" and "Jenn" might be splitting up. To the world, they were a team, their very names strung together like one word when their friends talked about them. Bart-n-Jenn.</p><p>Jenn Corbin was responsible for that. She had struggled to maintain the fa�ade that kept the foundering state of her marriage virtually invisible to the outside world. For at least eight years she continued to hope that she and Bart could somehow work out their problems and build a happy relationship. If they did accomplish that, there was no reason for anyone to know. If their union was irretrievably broken, people would know soon enough.</p><p>And know they would because, by the fall of 2004, Jenn had given up. Her parents, Narda and Max Barber, and her sisters, Heather and Rajel, knew that, although even they were reluctant to accept it. Jenn had tried to understand her husband and to make allowances for behavior she didn't understand. She had forgiven Bart for betrayals most other women would not put up with. It was he who had laid down the ground rules in their marriage, and she had accepted them. She hadn't gotten married with the idea that if it didn't work out, they could always get divorced. She and her sisters were born to parents who had married only once -- and who had just happily celebrated their fortieth anniversary.</p><p>Jenn Corbin was one of those people whom almost everybody liked, probably because she liked everybody. She thought of others before she took care of herself and she protected her small sons like a lioness would, doing everything she could to be sure they were serene and happy. She was the same way with the youngsters she taught in preschool at the church. She had a warm lap and sheltering arms when their tears came.</p><p>Jenn was a Barber before she became a Corbin, raised in a loving and a very close family. When she and Bart married, her family had opened up the circle and welcomed him in. Except for his occasional flashes of temper, Bart was a lot of fun and he happily participated in holi-day celebrations, outings on the Corbins' and Barbers' adjoining houseboats, or on picnics and trips. They all shared the kind of extended family loyalty that isn't seen very often.</p><p>Although Bart's mother, Connie, and his brothers -- Brad, Bart's twin, and Bobby -- didn't spend much time with the Barbers, their connection was amiable enough, if a bit distant. Bart's father, Gene Corbin, had remarried and wasn't often in touch.</p><p>The Corbins' marital difficulties didn't stem from in-law problems. Rather, Bart's new dental clinic was struggling, and a renewal of old issues had left their marriage on the precarious edge of oblivion. But with Christmas only three weeks away, Jenn was looking forward to finishing the decorations on a tall tree that sat in the Corbins' formal dining room. Her little boys shouldn't have to miss out on Santa Claus because of an adult situation that wasn't their fault. She was halfway through with the tree, and she had stacked boxes nearby that held her treasured sentimental ornaments, new ones she had purchased during the year, and, most precious, Dalton's and Dillon's handmade art work they were so proud of. Jenn already had wrapped and hidden lots of presents for the boys.</p><p></p><p>It was 7:30 on this Saturday morning, December 4, 2004, when Steve and Kelly Comeau, who lived across the street from the Corbins' house, were startled to hear someone knocking at their front door. They were still in bed; Steve had been out late helping a friend hang pictures, and on the way home he had stopped to help a stranded driver change a flat tire. When he answered the door, he looked down to see Dalton Corbin, age seven. Dalton's face was red and his cheeks were streaked with tears. He wore pajamas and appeared to be very upset.</p><p>"My mom isn't breathing," Dalton said. "My daddy shot my Mommy -- I need you to call 911."</p><p>Skeptical, Steve Comeau nevertheless called 911, while Kelly followed Dalton across the street to check on Jenn Corbin. She didn't even think about danger to herself, because she doubted that Dalton could really have seen what he said he had. Jenn was most likely just sleeping heavily.</p><p>The Corbins' overhead garage door was open. Kelly hurried beneath it, found that the door to the kitchen was unlocked, and headed down the hall toward the master bedroom, calling out Jenn's name. There was no answer.</p><p>There was light in the bedroom, although Kelly couldn't remember later if it was daylight or from a lamp. She could see Jenn lying diagonally across the bed. It was an odd position, and Kelly felt a little shiver of alarm. She told herself that Jenn was only sleeping, and she reached out to ...</p></p><h2>A Chosen Faith: An Introduction to Unitarian Universalism</h2><p>For those contemplating religious choices, Unitarian Universalism offers an appealing alternative to religious denominations that stress theological creeds over individual conviction and belief. In this new edition of the classic introductory text on Unitarian Universalism, which includes a revealing, entertaining foreword by best-selling author Robert Fulghum (<i>All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten, It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It</i>), a new preface by UU moderator Denise Davidoff, and two new chapters by the authors, John Buehrens and Forrest Church explore the many sources of the living tradition of their chosen faith.</p><p><i>A Chosen Faith: An Introduction to Unitarian Universalism</i>, by John A. Buehrens and Forrest Church, is hard to describe. The book is a history of the denomination, with lively passages depicting the lives and ministries of important Unitarian-Universalist leaders such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and William Ellery Channing. Yet it is also a collection of testimonies by contemporary laypeople and ministers, who describe their churches' responses to questions ranging from "How do I know when to get married?" to "How should the government treat single mothers?" The funny and wise introduction was written by Robert Fulghum, who indulges the often invoked criticism that Unitarian Universalism's ideals are interchangeable with those of PBS. And, finally, it contains some straightforward explications of the denomination's core principles. The Church's aversion to creeds will be off-putting to some readers--at times, it seems Unitarian Universalists believe in nothing so much as not committing to any one belief. But there's something universally refreshing about this protean faith: most religious people, at one time or another, find that God leads them to reject some tenets of their religion. Unitarian Universalists have a true genius for accepting God's most surprising Words, which makes <i>A Chosen Faith</i> a valuable resource for all of us. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>John A. Buehrens was President of the Unitarian Universalist Association. He served for twenty years as a parish minister in Knoxville, Dallas, and New York City. Forrest Church, minister of the Unitarian Church of All Souls in New York, is the author of many books, most recently <i>God and Other Famous Liberals</i> and <i>Life Lines.</i></p><h2>Overcomer (Softcover), The Official Novelization Based on the Overcomer Movie, This Inspirational Book Also Available in Hardcover and E-Book</h2><p>Based on the motion picture screenplay by Alex and Stephen Kendrick, Overcomer is one of 2019&#x2019;s best inspirational books.

Best of all, he's a gifted writer who possesses a delightfully devilish sense of humor. In these essays, which range widely but mostly focus on the relationships between biology and human behavior, hard and intricate science is handled with a deft touch that makes it accessible to the general reader. In one memorable piece, Sapolsky compares the fascination with tabloid TV to behavior he's observed among wild African baboons. "Rubber necks," notes the professor, "seem to be a common feature of the primate order." In the title essay of <i>The Trouble with Testosterone</i>, Sapolsky ruminates on the links, real or perceived, between that hormone and aggression.<b>Robert M.

An anomaly about the relic sets them off chasing a mystery&#x2014;but unknown to them, a much more powerful force is engaged in the same chase. Mexico&#x2019;s ruling party, the ultranationalist Mexica Tenochca, is intent on finding that artifact as well, because it contains a secret that could destroy the party utterly.<br>&nbsp;<br>Through Tanzania and Zanzibar, into the rainforests of Madagascar, and across the Indian Ocean to Indonesia and the legendary site of the 1883 Krakatoa explosion, the Fargos and their ruthless opponents pursue the hunt&#x2014;but only one can win. And the penalty for failure is death.</p><p><b>Clive Cussler&nbsp;</b>is the author of more than fifty books in five bestselling series, including Dirk Pitt, NUMA Files, Oregon Files, Isaac Bell, and Fargo. His life nearly parallels that of his hero Dirk Pitt. Whether searching for lost aircraft or leading expeditions to find famous shipwrecks, he and his NUMA crew of volunteers have discovered more than seventy-five lost ships of historic significance, including the long-lost Confederate submarine&nbsp;<i>Hunley</i>, which was raised in 2000 with much press publicity. Like Pitt, Cussler collects classic automobiles. His collection features more than eighty examples of custom coachwork. Cussler lives in Arizona and Colorado.<br><br><b>Grant Blackwood&nbsp;</b>is&nbsp;the author of the Briggs Tanner series, as well as the coauthor of #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller&nbsp;<i>Dead or Alive</i>, with Tom Clancy, and&nbsp;<i>The Kill Switch</i>, with James Rollins.&nbsp;A U.S. Navy veteran, he spent three years on active duty aboard the guided missile frigate USS Ford as an Operations Specialist and a Pilot Rescue Swimmer. He caught the fiction-writing bug at the age of eighteen while reading Clive Cussler&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Mediterranean Caper</i><b>.&nbsp;</b><br><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><b><br></b>This is the second installment (after Spartan Gold, 2009) of Cussler&#x2019;s action-packed new series featuring husband-and-wife treasure-hunters Sam and Remi Fargo, a spunky Nick and Nora for the twenty-first century. Scuba diving off the coast of East Africa, the couple discovers a bell, covered in cryptic carvings, from a long-lost Confederate warship. While they struggle to decode the clues found on the bell, a sinister faction is shadowing them in hopes of also discovering the secret to which the clues lead. Unlike the Fargos, this group does not want the secret uncovered and will kill to keep it hidden, as the discovery would result in a rewrite of the history books. In his inimitable way, Cussler throws everything into the pot: Confederate warships, the Aztecs, the Krakatoa explosion of 1883, pirates, and, in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock, Cussler himself in a cameo appearance. Blackwood, the coauthor, seems to have brought a breath of fresh air to Cussler&#x2019;s usual testosterone-laced style by toning down the traces of xenophobia and misogyny that often permeate the long-in-the-tooth Dirk Pitt series.

Based on sound research and the success of thousands of people, The Schwarzbein Principle proves that excess weight, degenerative disease and accelerated aging can be controlled &#x2014; and reversed &#x2014; in a healthful way.<br> <br> <i>The Schwarzbein Principle</i> is a holistic guide to achieving lasting weight loss, normalizing metabolism and maintaining ideal body composition through lifestyle and nutrition. By bringing the internal systems into balance, the Schwarzbein program has been proven to: reverse type II diabetes; free people from food cravings for chocolate, caffeine and sugar; cure depression and mood swings; and reduce body fat while building lean tissue. The nutritional program consists of two phases &#x2014;Healing and Maintenance &#x2014; which are easy to adopt into any lifestyle. Instead of shunning fat, the program advocates eating all of the good fats and proteins your body needs as well as an unlimited portion of non-starchy carbohydrates. By incorporating the lifestyle components of stress management, exercise and eliminating harmful stimulants, program participants experience renewed energy and vitality.</p><p>From her work with insulin-resistant patients with Type II diabetes, Dr. Schwarzbein concludes that low-fat diets cause heart attacks, eating fat makes you lose body fat, and it's important to eat high-cholesterol foods every day. Picture cardiologists and dieticians tearing their hair out and overweight people cheering as they dive into Eggs Benedict with sausage. <p> According to Schwarzbein, the high-carbohydrate, low-fat, moderate-protein diet that most dieticians and disease-prevention organizations recommend is the culprit that turns people into diabetics, makes them age faster and get degenerative diseases, and keeps them fat and unhealthy. She supports her theory with case studies of people who were sick and miserable on high-carbo, low-fat diets and who sprang to life when they "balanced" their diets with more fat and protein. Schwarzbein recommends avoiding "man-made carbohydrates"--processed carbs--in favor of those you could "pick, gather or milk." She instructs patients to eat "as much good fat as their body needs": eggs, avocados, flaxseed oil, butter, mayonnaise, and olive oil. Sorry, but fried foods and hydrogenated fats are "bad fats," or "damaged fats," as Schwarzbein calls them. You can eat as many eggs a day as you want on this plan, plus meat (even sausage--as long as it's nitrate-free--and p�t�), saturated fat, cream, and nonstarchy vegetables. The book includes a four-week meal plan and about 15 recipes.</p>Diana Schwarzbein, M.D., is a leading authority on metabolic healing. She founded The Endocrinology Institute of Santa Barbara where she sub-specializes in metabolism, diabetes, osteoporosis, menopause and thyroid conditions. Along with Nancy Deville, she coauthored The Schwarbein Principle. With Deville and Evelyn Jacob Jaffe, she coauthored The Schwarzbein Principle Cookbook and The Schwarzbein Principle Vegetarian Cookbook.</p><h2>The Forgiving Jar (Volume 2) (The Prayer Jars)</h2><p><b><i>What would happen if you found out someone has been impersonating you?</i><br> &nbsp;</b><br> Sara Murray had never met her mother&#x2019;s parents and was surprised to learn after her death that they were Amish living in Pennsylvania.

The princes, Little Ephraim Robin John and Ancona Robin Robin John, were themselves slave traders who were betrayed by African competitors--and so began their own extraordinary odyssey of enslavement. Their story, written in their own hand, survives as a rare firsthand account of the Atlantic slave experience. </p><p>Randy Sparks made the remarkable discovery of the princes' correspondence and has managed to reconstruct their adventures from it. They were transported from the coast of Africa to Dominica, where they were sold to a French physician. By employing their considerable language and interpersonal skills, they cleverly negotiated several escapes that took them from the Caribbean to Virginia, and to England, but always ended in their being enslaved again. Finally, in England, they sued for, and remarkably won, their freedom. Eventually, they found their way back to Old Calabar and, evidence suggests, resumed their business of slave trading.</p><p><i>The Two Princes of Calabar</i> offers a rare glimpse into the eighteenth-century Atlantic World and slave trade from an African perspective. It brings us into the trading communities along the coast of Africa and follows the regular movement of goods, people, and ideas across and around the Atlantic. It is an extraordinary tale of slaves' relentless quest for freedom and their important role in the creation of the modern Atlantic World.</p></p><p>Randy J. Sparks is Professor of History at Tulane University.&#x201c;This is a remarkable account of remarkable events. Of the millions of Africans ensnared by Atlantic slavery, a mere handful returned home. Randy Sparks' vivid exposition is about two African princes, slaves and slave traders, who found their way back to Africa. It is a tumultuous story but given persuasive coherence by Sparks' forensic researches and arresting prose. What he has produced is a finely-crafted miniature: a glimpse, via the lives of two men, into the broader contours of the enslaved Atlantic. The result is a literary treat which raises as many questions as it answers, and which provokes, instructs - and entertains.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Walvin, Professor of History, University of York</b><br><br>&#x201c;Randy Sparks' <i>Two Princes</i>, adds significantly to our growing knowledge of the complexity of human experiences of the Atlantic era, particularly those of people originating in Africa. This engagingly written study adds Ephraim Robin John and Ancona Robin Robin John to the bare two dozen or so known individuals who managed, in spite of the silencing anonymity of enslavement in Africa, to leave records, in their own voices, of the often-surprising stories of their lives.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joseph Miller, T. Cary Johnson, Jr. Professor of History, University of Virginia</b><br><br>&#x201c;Randy Sparks has done a great service to Atlantic History. <i>The Two Princes of Calabar</i> effectively integrates African and Atlantic history into an engaging and enlightening narrative. He succeeds in making the life of the Niger Delta trading states accessible to the general reader and brings their deep and remarkably sophisticated relationships with Europe to light with great style.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Thornton, author of <i>Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Randy Sparks' <i>The Two Princes of Calabar</i> is a great story. Great not only in that it is an extraordinary adventure that captures the drama, pathos, anguish, and ultimately the tragedy of the African slave trade, but also great in that it brings together all of the elements of the meeting of Africans, Europeans, and the Americans in the Atlantic.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ira Berlin, author of <i>Generations of Captivity</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;While researching a topic in early Methodism, Sparks discovered letters by former slaves to Charles Wesley.

Many of the old-time superstitions and customs have been nurtured and kept alive through the area's relative isolation and the strong attachment of the hillfolk to these old attitudes. Though modern science and education have been making important inroads in the last few decades, the region is still a fertile source of quaint ideas, observances, and traditions.<br>People are normally reticent about their deepest beliefs, especially with outsiders. The author, however, has lived in the Ozarks since 1920 and has long since been a student of Ozark life&#x2014;and a writer of a number of books and articles on various aspects of the subject. Through casual conversations rather than by direct questioning, he has been able gradually to compile a singularly authentic record of Ozark superstition. His book contains a vast amount of folkloristic material, including legends, beliefs, ritual verses and sayings and odd practices of the hillpeople, plus a wealth of general cultural data. Mr. Randolph discusses weather signs; beliefs about auspicious times for planting crops, butchering hogs, etc.; prenatal influence in "marking" babies; backwoods beauty treatments; lucky charms, omens and auguries; courtship jinxes, love potions, etc.; dummy suppers; and numerous other customs and convictions&#x2014;many racy and amusing, others somewhat grisly or spooky.<br>Here you'll meet and learn about the yarb doctor who prepared curious remedies of herbs and odd concoctions; power doctors who use charms, spells, and exorcism to effect cures; granny-women (mountain midwives); "doodlebuggers" and witch wigglers who find water with the aid of divining rods; "conjurefolk" and Holy Rollers; witches and goomer doctors; clairvoyants and fortune-tellers; plus the ordinary finger-crossing, wish-making citizens of the area.

Across north-eastern America the armies of Britain and France struggle for ascendancy. Their conflict, however, overlays older struggles between nations of native Americans for possession of the same lands and between the native peoples and white colonisers. Through these layers of conflict Cooper threads a thrilling narrative, in which Cora and Alice Munro, daughters of a British commander on the front line of the colonial war, attempt to join their father. Thwarted by Magua, the sinister 'Indian runner', they find help in the person of Hawk-eye, the white woodsman, and his companions, the Mohican Chingachgook and Uncas, his son, the last of his tribe. <br> Cooper's novel is full of vivid incident- pursuits through wild terrain, skirmishes, treachery and brutality- but reflects also on the interaction between the colonists and the native peoples. Through the character of Hawkeye, Cooper raises lasting questions about the practises of the American frontier and the eclipse of the indigenous cultures.</p><p>This book is in Electronic Paperback� Format.

Why does cancer develop? What's the connection between heart failure and Alzheimer's disease, or infertility and hearing loss? Can we extend lifespan, and if so, how? What is the Exercise Paradox? Why do antioxidant supplements sometimes do more harm than good? Many will be amazed to learn that all these questions, and many more, can be answered by a single point of discussion: mitochondria and bioenergetics.</p> <p>In <em>Mitochondria and the Future of Medicine</em>, Naturopathic Doctor Lee Know tells the epic story of mitochondria, the widely misunderstood and often-overlooked powerhouses of our cells. The legendary saga began over two billion years ago, when one bacterium entered another without being digested, which would evolve to create the first mitochondrion. Since then, for life to exist beyond single-celled bacteria, it's the mitochondria that have been responsible for this life-giving energy. By understanding how our mitochondria work, in fact, it is possible to add years to our lives, and life to our years.</p> <p>Current research, however, has revealed a dark side: many seemingly disconnected degenerative diseases have tangled roots in dysfunctional mitochondria. However, modern research has also endowed us with the knowledge on how to optimize its function, which is of critical importance to our health and longevity. Lee Know offers cutting-edge information on supplementation and lifestyle changes for mitochondrial optimization, such as CoQ10, D-Ribose, cannabinoids, and ketogenic dietary therapy, and how to implement their use successfully. <em>Mitochondria and the Future of Medicine</em> is an invaluable resource for practitioners interested in mitochondrial medicine and the true roots of chronic illness and disease, as well as anyone interested in optimizing their health.</p></p><p><p>Lee Know, ND, is a licensed naturopathic doctor based out of Canada, and the recipient of several awards. Known by his peers to be a strategic and forward-thinking entrepreneur and researcher, he has held positions as medical advisor, scientific evaluator, and director of research and development for major organizations. Besides managing Scientific Affairs for his own company, he also currently serves as a consultant to the natural-health-products and dietary-supplements industries, and serves on the editorial advisory board for Canada's most-read natural health magazine. He calls the Greater Toronto Area home, where he lives with his common-law partner and their two sons, and has a particular interest in promoting natural health and environmental stewardship.</p><p>&#x201c;The topic of mitochondria may seem dry and uninteresting to the&nbsp;uninitiated, but this book makes mitochondria come to life with vivid&nbsp;descriptions accessible even to those with no training in biology.&nbsp;From&nbsp;infertility to aging to cancer and neurological disease, Dr. Lee Know&nbsp;will teach you that mitochondria play a central role in much that we&nbsp;care about in health and disease.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Stephanie Seneff, PhD, senior research scientist, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In 1991, when faced with my own health challenges, mitochondria became front and center in my quest for health. Over the last two and a half decades, more and more researchers and clinicians are finding themselves interested in these little powerhouses and proclaiming themselves &#x2018;mitochondriacs.&#x2019; Dr. Lee Know does a brilliant job shedding light on this once ignored organelle and shows us how to care for our most important metabolic system.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Dr. Nasha Winters, co-author of <em>The Metabolic Approach to Cancer</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Mitochondria and the Future of Medicine&nbsp;</em>is a tour de force of mitochondria and human health.

Here, he clearly and concisely describes mitochondrial structure and function while presenting us with multiple examples of why healthy mitochondria are so crucial to our overall health. Without conjecture or overreach, Dr. Know also provides the rationale behind nutritional strategies that have great potential to improve the status of our mitochondria, a central tenet of healthy aging.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Miriam Kalamian, author of <em>Keto for Cancer</em></strong></p></p><h2>Origins of the Kabbalah (Princeton Paperbacks)</h2><p><p>One of the most important scholars of our century, Gershom Scholem (1897-1982) opened up a once esoteric world of Jewish mysticism, the Kabbalah, to concerned students of religion. The Kabbalah is a rich tradition of repeated attempts to achieve and portray direct experiences of God: its twelfth-and thirteenth-century beginnings in southern France and Spain are probed in Origins of the Kabbalah, a work crucial in Scholem's oeuvre. The book is a contribution not only to the history of Jewish medieval mysticism but also to the study of medieval mysticism in general and will be of interest to historians and psychologists, as well as to students of the history of religion.</p></p><p>Gershom Scholem's <i>Origins of the Kabbalah</i> provides a painstakingly detailed history of Kabbalah's rise among medieval French and Spanish Jews, describes the first publication of Jewish mystical texts, and investigates the growth of their influence on Jewish religious life. The book also doubles back to describe secret traditions of Jewish Gnosticism, which describe a Creation story so numerological and esoteric it makes the New Testament book of Revelation look as simple and straightforward as a Saturday-morning cartoon. This book is much denser than Scholem's excellent <i>On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism</i>, but for readers with a basic knowledge of Kabbalah, it shouldn't be rough going. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Black Hills (A Hunter Buchanon Black Hills Western)</h2><p><b>Johnstone Country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Frontier Spirit Lives Here.</b> <b>&nbsp;<br></b><br> <b>Meet Hunter Buchanon, a towering mountain of a man who learned how to track prey in Georgia, kill in the Civil War, and prospect in the Black Hills of Dakota.

Plucking the feathers of meaning that cover the voice, dismantling the body from which the voice seems to emanate, resisting the Sirens' song of fascination with the voice, concentrating on "the voice and nothing more": this is the difficult task that philosopher Mladen Dolar relentlessly pursues in this seminal work.</p><p>The voice did not figure as a major philosophical topic until the 1960s, when Derrida and Lacan separately proposed it as a central theoretical concern. In <i>A Voice and Nothing More</i> Dolar goes beyond Derrida's idea of "phonocentrism" and revives and develops Lacan's claim that the voice is one of the paramount embodiments of the psychoanalytic object (objet a). Dolar proposes that, apart from the two commonly understood uses of the voice as a vehicle of meaning and as a source of aesthetic admiration, there is a third level of understanding: the voice as an object that can be seen as the lever of thought. He investigates the object voice on a number of different levels&#x2015;the linguistics of the voice, the metaphysics of the voice, the ethics of the voice (with the voice of conscience), the paradoxical relation between the voice and the body, the politics of the voice&#x2015;and he scrutinizes the uses of the voice in Freud and Kafka. With this foundational work, Dolar gives us a philosophically grounded theory of the voice as a Lacanian object-cause.</p></p><p>Mladen Dolar taught for 20 years in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, where he now works as a Senior Research Fellow. He is the author of a number of books, most recently (with Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek) <i>Opera's Second Death</i>.<p>An immensely ambitious theoretical edifice in which new relations between Kant and Marx are established, as well as a new kind of synthesis between Marxism and anarchism. The book is timely from both practical and theoretical perspectives, and stands up well against a tradition of Marx exegesis that runs from Rosdolsky and Korsch to Althusser and Tony Smith.</p>&#x2015;<b>Fredric Jameson</b>, William A. Lane, Jr., Professor of Comparative Literature, Duke University<br><br><p>Miladen Dolar's book breaks through the impasse of extrinsic vs. intrinsic accounts of the voice, and shows how they fail to get at its truly uncanny topology and its strange persistence within and beyond the multiple significations it carries. Firmly rooted in Lacan and Freud, his argument passes through an extraordinary range of texts on voice, from Plato and Augustine to Kafka, Lewis Carroll, and Charlie Chaplin. dolar's readings are strong, lucid, and convincing, and he writes with a warm with and intelligence that are entirely his own. He has written, without a doubt, the definitive book on the topic.</p>&#x2015;<b>Kenneth Reinhard</b>, Departments of English and Comparative Literature, Unviversity of California<br><br><p>In his first <i>Duino Elegy </i>and in a strophe dedicated to the hearing of voices, Rilke speaks of 'the ceaseless message that forms itself from silence.' In this <i>tour de force</i> of philosophical engagement with our acoustic universe, Mladen Dolar has given us the key to this message, to what it means to be genuinely responsive to it. Our understanding of language, ethics, politics, philosophy, and aesthetic experience will never be the same.</p>&#x2015;<b>Eric L.

Steely and silky Abbess Alexandra (whose aristocratic tastes run to p�t�, fine wine, English poetry, and carpets of &#x201c;amorous green&#x201d;) has bugged the convent, and rigged her election. But the cat gets out of the bag, and&#x2015;plunged into scandal&#x2015;the serene Abbess faces a Vatican inquiry.</p><p>Published in 1974 and inspired by Watergate, Muriel Spark's <i>Abbess of Crewe</i> is much more amusing and infinitely drier. It transpires that Alexandra, the title character, has bugged and videotaped the Abbey--except for the confessionals and chapel--with electronic "devices fearfully and wonderfully beyond the reach of a humane vocabulary." After her only rival decamps for London and the arms of a Jesuit, police and newspapers swoop in. All the while, the Abbess (an adherent of Machiavelli, The Art of War, and the Modernist poets) keeps her cool, sacrificing her confederates as necessary and trying to assure herself of helicopter-hopping Gertrude's loyalty. (Gertrude is off curing cannibals of their customs and calls in occasionally from places whose unpronounceable names will soon be replaced by other equally unpronounceable names.) Spark's nuns on the run are more than stand-ins for the sweaty American President and his operatives; the satire extends to Anglo-snobbism and -Catholicism. The Abbess explains to the Pope that "electronic surveillance (even if a convent were one day to practise it) does not differ from any other type of watchfulness, the which is a necessity of a Religious Community; we are told in the Scriptures 'to watch and to pray,' which is itself a paradox."An elegant fable about intrigue, corruption, and electronic surveillance, &#39;The Abbess of Crewe&#39; (1974) is set in an English Benedictine convent.

We learn from the out-set that a strange plague has descended upon the area&#x2019;s teenagers, transmitted by sexual contact. The disease is manifested in any number of ways &#x2014; from the hideously grotesque to the subtle (and concealable) &#x2014; but once you&#x2019;ve got it, that&#x2019;s it. There&#x2019;s no turning back.<br><br>As we inhabit the heads of several key characters &#x2014; some kids who have it, some who don&#x2019;t, some who are about to get it &#x2014; what unfolds isn&#x2019;t the expected battle to fight the plague, or bring heightened awareness to it , or even to treat it. What we become witness to instead is a fascinating and eerie portrait of the nature of high school alienation itself &#x2014; the savagery, the cruelty, the relentless anxiety and ennui, the longing for escape.<br><br>And then the murders start.<br><br>As hypnotically beautiful as it is horrifying, <i>Black Hole</i> transcends its genre by deftly exploring a specific American cultural moment in flux and the kids who are caught in it- back when it wasn&#x2019;t exactly cool to be a hippie anymore, but Bowie was still just a little too weird. <br><br>To say nothing of sprouting horns and molting your skin...</p><p>The first issues of Charles Burns's comics series <i>Black Hole</i> began appearing in 1995, and long before it was completed a decade later, readers and fellow artists were speaking of it in tones of awe and comparing it to recent classics of the form like Chris Ware's <i>Jimmy Corrigan</i> and Daniel Clowes's <i>Ghost World</i>. Burns is the sort of meticulous, uncompromising artist whom other artists speak of with envy and reverence, and we asked Ware and Clowes to comment on their admiration for <i>Black Hole</i>:<p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"I think I probably learned the most about clarity, composition, and efficiency from looking at Charles's pages spread out on my drawing table than from anyone's; his was always at the level of lucidity of <i>Nancy</i>, but with this odd, metallic tinge to it that left you feeling very unsettled, especially if you were an aspiring cartoonist, because it was clear you'd never be half as good as he was. There's an almost metaphysical intensity to his pinprick-like inkline that catches you somewhere in the back of the throat, a paper-thin blade of a fine jeweler's saw tracing the outline of these thick, clay-like human figures that somehow seem to "move," but are also inevitably oddly frozen in eternal, awkward poses ... it's an unlikely combination of feelings, and it all adds up to something unmistakably his own.<p> "I must have been one of the first customers to arrive at the comic shop when I heard the first issue of <i>Black Hole</i> was out 10 years ago, and my excitement didn't change over the years as he completed it. I don't think I've ever read anything that better captures the details, feelings, anxieties, smells, and cringing horror of my own teenage years better than <i>Black Hole</i>, and I'm 15 years younger than Charles is. <i>Black Hole</i> is so redolently affecting one almost has to put the book down for air every once in a while. By the book's end, one ends up feeling so deeply for the main character it's all one can do not to turn the book over and start reading again." --<i>Chris Ware</i> </p></td> </tr><tr> </tr><tr> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"Charles Burns is one of the greats of modern comics. His comics are beautiful on so many levels. Somehow he has managed to capture the essential electricity of comic-book pop-art iconography, dragging it from the clutches of Fine Art back to the service of his perfect, precise-but-elusive narratives in a way that is both universal in its instant appeal and deeply personal." --<i>Dan Clowes</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong>Questions for Charles Burns</strong></p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Cartoonists are about the only people today who are working like Dickens did: writing serials that appear piece-by-piece in public before the whole work is done. What's it like to work in public like that, and for as long as a project like this takes?<br> <strong>Charles Burns:</strong> There were a number of reasons for serializing <i>Black Hole</i>. First of all, I wanted to put out a traditional comic book-- I'd never really worked in that comic pamphlet format before and liked the idea of developing a long story in installments. There's something very satisfying to me about a comic book as an object and I enjoyed using that format to slowly build my story. Serializing the story also allowed me to focus on shorter, more manageable portions; if I had to face creating a 368-page book all in one big lump, I don't know if I&#x2019;d have the perseverance and energy to pull it off.<br> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> One thing that stuns me about this book is how consistent it is from start to finish. From the first frames to the last ones that you drew 10 years later, you held the same tone and style. It feels as though you had a complete vision for the book from the very beginning. Is that so? Or did things develop unexpectedly as you worked on it?<br> <strong>Burns:</strong> I guess there's a consistency in <i>Black Hole</i> because of the way I work. I write and draw very slowly, always carefully examining every little detail to make sure it all fits together the way I want it to. When I started the story, I had it all charted out as far as the basic structure goes, but what made working on it interesting was finding new ways of telling the story that hadn't occurred to me.<br> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Some of the very best of the recent graphic novels (I'm thinking of <i>Ghost World</i> and <i>Blankets</i>, along with <i>Black Hole</i>) have been about the lives of teenagers. Do you think there's something about the form that helps to tell those stories so well?<br> <strong>Burns:</strong> That's an interesting question, but I don't know the answer. Perhaps it has more to do with the authors--the kind of people who stay indoors for hours on end in total solitude working away on their heartfelt stories... maybe that kind of reflection lends itself to being able to capture the intensity of adolescence.<br> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> In the time you've been working on <i>Black Hole</i>, graphic novels have leapt into the mainstream. (I think--I hope--we're finally seeing the last of those "They're not just for kids anymore!" reviews.) What did you imagine for this project when you started it? What's it been like to see your corner of the world enter the glare of the spotlight?<br> <strong>Burns:</strong> When I started <i>Black Hole</i> I really just wanted to tell a long, well-written story. The themes and ideas that run throughout the book had been turning around in my head for years and I wanted to finally get them all out--put them down on paper once and for all. I've published a few other books and while they sold reasonably well, they didn't set the publishing world on fire. I was pretty sure I'd have some kind of an audience for <i>Black Hole</i>, but that was never a motivating factor in writing the book. And my corner of the world is still pretty dark. I guess I'll be stepping into the spotlight for a little while when the book comes out, but I imagine I'll slip back into my dark little studio when it all settles down again so I can settle back into work. </p><p></p>Charles Burns grew up in Seattle in the 1970s.

The book, in Edward Greenstein&#x2019;s characterization, is &#x201c;a Wunderkind, a genius emerging out of the confluence of two literary streams&#x201d; which &#x201c;dazzles like Shakespeare with unrivaled vocabulary and a penchant for linguistic innovation.&#x201d; Despite the text&#x2019;s literary prestige and cultural prominence, no English translation has come close to conveying the proper sense of the original. The book has consequently been misunderstood in innumerable details and in its main themes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Edward Greenstein&#x2019;s new translation of Job is the culmination of decades of intensive research and painstaking philological and literary analysis, offering a major reinterpretation of this canonical text. Through his beautifully rendered translation and insightful introduction and commentary, Greenstein presents a new perspective: Job, he shows, was defiant of God until the end.

Character may be simply defined by what someone does not do, but a more active and thorough definition is necessary, one that addresses certain vital questions. Is character a singular characteristic of an individual, or is it composed of different aspects? Does character--however we define it--exist in degrees, or is it simply something one happens to have? How can character be developed? Can it be learned? Relatedly, can it be taught, and who might be the most effective teacher? What roles are played by family, schools, the media, religion, and the larger culture? This groundbreaking handbook of character strengths and virtues is the first progress report from a prestigious group of researchers who have undertaken the systematic classification and measurement of widely valued positive traits. They approach good character in terms of separate strengths-authenticity, persistence, kindness, gratitude, hope, humor, and so on-each of which exists in degrees. <br><br><em>Character Strengths and Virtues</em> classifies twenty-four specific strengths under six broad virtues that consistently emerge across history and culture: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Each strength is thoroughly examined in its own chapter, with special attention to its meaning, explanation, measurement, causes, correlates, consequences, and development across the life span, as well as to strategies for its deliberate cultivation. This book demands the attention of anyone interested in psychology and what it can teach about the good life.<br></p><p>Christopher Peterson is at University of Michigan. Martin E. P.

An especially nice feature of the Handbook is that it points out distinctions between Roman Catholic and Protestant terminologies, important in these ecumenical times when we often dialog together and take courses at each other&#39;s colleges and seminaries. There are glossaries and dictionaries that are more up to date but that&#39;s not always an advantage, because their trendiness comes at the expense of excluding theological terms that are centuries old and will be around for centuries to come. I&#39;m not sure the lay person will have much need for the Handbook, but by all means if people at your church are arrogant enough to use terms like &#34;Arianism,&#34; &#34;Docetism&#34; or &#34;Prevenient Grace&#34; without defining them, get yourself a copy and fight back!</p><p>Professor Van A.

In their gross and subtle forms, these elements combine to make up the infinite illusory display of phenomenal existence. Through teachings, stories, and his distinctive use of language, Thinley Norbu Rinpoche relates how the energies of the elements manifest within our everyday world, in individual behavior and group traditions, relationships and solitude, medicine and art. He explains their links to the five Buddha families and their respective Wisdom Dakinis, and shows how each element relates to our senses, temperament, passions, habits, and karmic potentials. This magic dance of the elements, he concludes, can be transformed through meditation practice and cultivating the calm, vast, and playful state of consciousness that he calls &#34;playmind.&#34;</p><p>Thinley Norbu Rinpoche (1931&#x2013;2011) was a preeminent teacher in the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism. The eldest son of His Holiness D�djom Rinpoche, he was a primary holder of the D�djom Tersar lineage and considered to be an emanation of Longchenpa, the great fourteenth-century Nyingma master.</p><h2>The Second Epistle to the Corinthians (The New International Commentary on the New Testament)</h2><p>This statement reflects the underlying purpose of The New International Commentary on the New Testament. Begun in the late 1940s by an international team of New Testament scholars, the NICNT series has become recognized by pastors, students, and scholars alike as a critical yet orthodox commentary marked by solid biblical scholarship within the evangelical Protestant tradition.<br><br> While based on a thorough study of the Greek text, the commentary introductions and expositions contain a minimum of Greek references. The NICNT authors evaluate significant textual problems and take into account the most important exegetical literature. More technical aspects &#x2015; such as grammatical, textual, and historical problems &#x2015; are dealt with in footnotes, special notes, and appendixes.<br><br> Under the general editorship of three outstanding New Testament scholars &#x2015; first Ned Stonehouse (Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia), then F. F. Bruce (University of Manchester, England), and now Gordon D. Fee (Regent College, Vancouver, British Columbia) &#x2015; the NICNT series has continued to develop over the years. In order to keep the commentary &#x201c;new&#x201d; and conversant with contemporary scholarship, the NICNT volumes have been &#x2015; and will be &#x2015; revised or replaced as necessary.<br><br> The newer NICNT volumes in particular take into account the role of recent rhetorical and sociological inquiry in elucidating the meaning of the text, and they also exhibit concern for the theology and application of the text. As the NICNT series is ever brought up to date, it will continue to find ongoing usefulness as an established guide to the New Testament text.</p><p>This excellent commentary on 2 Corinthians by Paul Barnett illumines the historical background of the church at Corinth and clarifies the meaning of Paul&#39;s passionate letter both for those first-century Christians and for the church today. Assuming the unity of the letter, for which extensive argument is offered, Barnett takes the view that Paul is, in particular, addressing the issue of triumphalism in Corinth. This triumphalism is expressed by the newly arrived missioners who portray Paul as &#34;inferior&#34; to themselves; it is also endemic among the Corinthians. According to Barnett, the recurring theme of the letter is &#34;power-in-weakness&#34;, based on the motif of the Resurrection of the Crucified, which lies at the heart of the gospel of Christ. Also fundamental to the letter is the theme of fulfillment of the &#34;promises of God&#34; by Christ and the Spirit under the New Covenant. Written for scholars, pastors, and lay readers alike, this new commentary on 2 Corinthians will be a lasting reference work for those interested in this important section of Scripture.Paul Barnett is visiting fellow in ancient history at MacquarieUniversity, Sydney, Australia, and teaching fellow in biblicalstudies at Regent College, Vancouver, British Columbia.</p><h2>Pregnant Darkness: Alchemy and the Rebirth of Consciousness</h2><p><p>Author, psychologist, and astrologer Monika Wikman has worked for decades with clients and their dream symbols and witnessed the presence of the divine hand at work in the psyche. In <i>The Pregnant Darkness</i>, Wikman shows readers that the best way to cope with their darkest hours is by fostering a connection to the deeper current of life, those mysteries that give life form and meaning. Wikman's analysis of dream material leads readers into a practical explanation of alchemical symbolism. Far from being a quaint, ancient practice, <i>The Pregnant Darkness<i> shows that alchemy is at work in contemporary, everyday life. Alchemical symbolism, properly understood, can be applied to unraveling the meaning of visions in meditation, active imagination, and dream work. Wikman shows how readers can participate in the divine energies to help miraculous changes occur in their lives.</i></i></p><p><i><i>Wikman writes: "In Greek mythology, Pegasus, upon taking to the air, pushed hard with a back hoof and penetrated the earth. A spring rose up where his hoof dashed the earth, and in this hole . . . the muses reside. One of the roles of the "religious function" of which Jung speaks is to bring us toward that inner spring of the muses where something beyond ego resides, instructs, and inspires. Like a hole created from Pegasus' leaping foot, contact with this inner spring often entails a crack in our field of ordinary consciousness. In the inner world, the spring of living symbols and accompanying presences is the source of dreams and visions, as well as the fountain of inspiration at the heart of poetry, art, ritual, mythology, and even religion."</i></i></p></p><p>Monika Wikman is a Jungian analyst and astrologer.

These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Missalthwaite hides another secret, as Mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic wil work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>Plays: Maria Irene Fornes (PAJ Books)</h2><p>The celebrated playwright, director, translator, lyricist, and seven-time Obie Award winner, has been an influential voice in American theatre for more than four decades and a highly-regarded teacher of playwriting.

It was noon. He shuffled forward, fighting gravity and exhaustion, his will keeping him upright and moving. His mouth was full of the rusty taste of old fear; his stomach had given up complaining about the absence of food days ago. His hands wrapped around the leather reins, using them to lead Promise ever forward. They were a lifeline, helping him to keep standing, keep walking. <br>Promise was in bad shape. A hard tumble down one of the dunes in the 40-Mile Desert was forcing her to keep weight off her left hind leg. She was staggering along as best she could, just like Jim. He hadn&#x2019;t ridden her since the fall yesterday, but he knew that if he didn&#x2019;t try to get up on her and get moving, they were both as good as buzzard food soon. At their present pace, they still had a good three or four days of traveling through this wasteland before they would reach Virginia City and the mythical job with the railroad. <br>Right now, he didn&#x2019;t care that he had no money in his pockets. He didn&#x2019;t care that he only had a few tepid swallows of water left in his canteen or that if he managed to make it to Virginia City he might be recognized from a wanted poster and sent back to Albright for a proper hanging. Right now, all he was worried about was saving his horse, the brown mustang that had been his companion since he was a child. <br>Promise snorted dust out of her dark nostrils. She shook her head and slowed. <br>&#x201c;Come on, girl,&#x201d; he croaked through a throat that felt like it was filled with broken shale. &#x201c;Just a little ways longer. Come on.&#x201d; <br>The mare reluctantly heeded Jim&#x2019;s insistent tugging on the reins and lurched forward again. Jim rubbed her neck. <br>&#x201c;Good girl, Promise. Good girl.&#x201d; <br>The horse&#x2019;s eyes were wide with crazy fear, but she listened to Jim&#x2019;s voice and trusted in it. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get us out of here, girl. I swear I will.&#x201d; But he knew that was a lie. He was as frightened as Promise. He was fifteen years old and he was going to die out here, thousands of miles from his home and family. <br>They continued on, heading west, always west. Jim knew far ahead of them lay the Carson River, but it might as well be on the moon. They were following the ruts of old wagon train paths, years old. If they had more water and some shelter, they might make it, but they didn&#x2019;t. The brackish salt ponds they passed spoke to the infernal nature of this place. For days now, they had stumbled over the bleached bones of horses, and worse. Other lost souls, consigned to the waste of the 40-Mile. <br>During the seemingly endless walk, Jim had found artifacts, partially eaten by the sand and clay&#x2014;the cracked porcelain face of a little girl&#x2019;s doll. It made him think of Lottie. She&#x2019;d be seven now. A broken pocket watch held a sun-faded photograph of a stern-looking man dressed in a Union uniform. It reminded him of Pa. Jim wondered if some unfortunate wandering this path in the future would find a token of his and Promise&#x2019;s passing, the only record of his exodus through this godforsaken land, the only proof that he had ever existed at all. <br>He fished the eye out of his trouser pocket and examined it in the unforgiving sunlight. It was a perfect orb of milky glass. Inlaid in the orb was a dark circle and, within it, a perfect ring of frosted jade. At the center of the jade ring was an oval of night. When the light struck the jade at just the right angle, tiny unreadable characters could be seen engraved in the stone. It was his father&#x2019;s eye, and it was the reason for the beginning and the end of his journey. He put it back in a handkerchief and stuffed it in his pocket, filled with an angry desire to deny it to the desert. He pressed onward and Promise reluctantly followed. <br>He had long ago lost track of concepts like time. Days were starting to bleed into one another as the buzzing in his head, like angry hornets, grew stronger and more insistent with each passing step. But he knew the sun was more before him now than behind him. He stopped again. When had he stopped to look at the eye? Minutes ago, years? The wagon trails, fossilized and twisting through the baked landscape, had brought him to a crossroads in the wasteland. Two rutted paths crossed near a pile of skulls. Most of the skulls belonged to cattle and coyotes, but the number that belonged to animals of the two-legged variety unnerved Jim. Atop the pile was a piece of slate, a child&#x2019;s broken and discarded chalkboard, faded by sand, salt and sun. On it, in red paint, written in a crude, looping scrawl were the words: <i>Golgotha: 18 mi. Redemption: 32 mi. Salvation: 50 mi.</i> <br>During Jim&#x2019;s few furtive days in Panacea, after crossing over from Utah, he had been surprised by the number of Mormons in Nevada and how much influence they had already accumulated in this young state. There were numerous small towns and outposts dotting the landscape with the most peculiar religious names, marking the Mormon emigration west. He had never heard of any of these towns, but if there were people there would be fresh water and shelter from the sun. <br>&#x201c;See, Promise, only eighteen more miles to go and we&#x2019;re home free, girl.&#x201d; He pulled the reins, and they were off again. He didn&#x2019;t much care for staying in a place named Golgotha, but he was more than willing to visit a spell. <br>The trail continued, the distance measured by the increasing ache in Jim&#x2019;s dried-out muscles, the growing hum in his head that was obscuring thought. The sun was retreating behind distant, shadowy hills. The relief from the sun was a fleeting victory. Already a chill was settling over his red, swollen skin as the desert&#x2019;s temperature began to plunge. Promise shivered too and snorted in discomfort. There was only so much farther she could go without rest. He knew it would be better to travel at night and take advantage of the reprieve from the sun, but he was simply too tired and too cold to go on, and he feared wandering off the wagon trail in the darkness and becoming lost. <br>He was looking for a place to hole up for the night when Promise suddenly gave a violent whinny and reared up on her hind legs. Jim, still holding the reins, felt himself jerked violently off the ground. Promise&#x2019;s injured hind leg gave way and both boy and horse tumbled down a rocky shelf off to the left of the rutted path. There was confusion, and falling and then a sudden, brutal stop. Jim was prone with his back against Promise&#x2019;s flank. After a few feeble attempts to rise, the horse whimpered and stopped trying. <br>Jim stood, beating the dust off his clothes. Other than a wicked burn on his wrist where the leather reins had torn away the skin, he was unharmed. The small gully they were in had walls of crumbling clay and was sparsely dotted with sickly sage plants. Jim knelt near Promise&#x2019;s head and stroked the shaking mare. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, girl. We both need a rest. You just close your eyes, now. I&#x2019;ve got you. You&#x2019;re safe with me.&#x201d; <br>A coyote howled in the distance, and his brethren picked up the cry. The sky was darkening from indigo to black. Jim fumbled in his saddlebags and removed Pa&#x2019;s pistol, the one he had used in the war. He checked the cylinder of the .44 Colt and snapped the breech closed, satisfied that it was ready to fire. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, girl; ain&#x2019;t nobody gitting you tonight. I promised you I&#x2019;d get us out of here, and I&#x2019;m going to keep my word. A man ain&#x2019;t no good for nothing if he don&#x2019;t keep his word.&#x201d; <br>Jim slid the coarse army blanket and bedroll off the saddle. He draped the blanket over Promise as best he could, and wrapped himself in the thin bedding. The wind picked up a few feet above their heads, whistling and shrieking. A river of swirling dust flowed over them, carried by the terrible sound. When he had been a boy, Jim had been afraid of the wind moaning, like a restless haint, around the rafters where his bed was nestled. Even though he knew he was a man now and men didn&#x2019;t cotton to such fears, this place made him feel small and alone. <br>After an hour, he checked Promise&#x2019;s leg. It was bad, but not so bad yet that it couldn&#x2019;t heal. He wished he had a warm stable and some oats and water to give her, a clean brush for her hide. He&#x2019;d settle for the water, though. She was strong, her heart was strong, but it had been days since she had taken in water. Strength and heart only went so far in the desert. From her labored breathing, that wasn&#x2019;t going to be enough to reach Golgotha. <br>The frost settled into his bones sometime in the endless night. Even fear and the cold weren&#x2019;t enough to keep him anchored to this world. He slipped into the warm, narcotic arms of sleep. <br>His eyes snapped open. The coyote was less than three feet from his face. Its breath swirled, a mask of silver mist in the space between them. Its eyes were embers in a fireplace. There was intelligence behind the red eyes, worming itself into Jim&#x2019;s innards. In his mind, he heard chanting, drums. He saw himself as a rabbit&#x2014;weak, scared, prey. <br>Jim remembered the gun. His frozen fingers fumbled numbly for it on the ground. <br>The coyote narrowed its gaze and showed yellowed teeth. Some were crooked, snagged, but the canines were sharp and straight. <br> <i>You think you can kill me with slow, spiritless lead, little rabbit?</i> Its eyes spoke to Jim. <i>I am the fire giver, the trickster spirit. I am faster than Old Man Rattler, quieter than the Moon Woman&#x2019;s light. See, go on, see! Shoot me with your dead, empty gun.</i> <br>Jim glanced down at the gun, slid his palm around the butt and brought it up quickly. The coyote was gone; only the fog of its breath remained. Jim heard the coyote yipping in the distance. It sounded like laughter at his expense. <br>His eyes drooped, and closed. <br>He awoke with a start. It was still dark, but dawn was a threat on the horizon. The gun was in his hand. He saw the coyote&#x2019;s tracks and wondered again if perhaps he had already died out here and was now wandering Hell&#x2019;s foyer, being taunted by demon dogs and cursed with eternal thirst as penance for the crimes he had committed back home. <br>Promise stirred, fitfully, made a few pitiful sounds and then was still. Jim rested his head on her side. Her heart still beat; her lungs struggled to draw air. <br>If he was in Hell, he deserved it, alone. He stroked her mane and waited for the Devil to rise up, bloated and scarlet in the east. He dozed again. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>He remembered how strong his father&#x2019;s hands were, but how soft his voice was too. Pa seldom shouted &#x2019;less he had been drinking on account of the headaches. <br>It was a cold West Virginia spring. The frost still clung to the delicate, blooming blue sailors and the cemetery plants early in the morning, but, by noon, the sky was clear and bright and the blustery wind blowing through the mountains was more warm than chill. <br>Pa and Jim were mending some of Old Man Wimmer&#x2019;s fences alongside their own property. Pa had done odd jobs for folk all over Preston County since he had come back from the war. He had even helped build onto the Cheat River Saloon over in Albright, the closest town to the Negrey homestead. <br>Lottie had brought a lunch pail over to them: corn muffins, a little butter and some apples as well as a bucket of fresh water. Lottie was five then, and her hair was the same straw color as Jim&#x2019;s, only lighter, more golden in the sunlight. It fell almost to her waist, and Momma brushed it with her fine silver combs in the firelight at night before bedtime. The memory made Jim&#x2019;s heart ache. It was what he thought of whenever he thought of home. <br>&#x201c;Is it good, Daddy?&#x201d; Lottie asked Pa. He was leaning against the fence post, eagerly finishing off his apple. <br>&#x201c;M&#x2019;hm.&#x201d; He nodded. &#x201c;Tell your ma, these doings are a powerful sight better than those sheet-iron crackers and skillygallee old General Pope used to feed us, darling.&#x201d; <br>Jim took a long, cool draw off the water ladle and looked at Pa, sitting there, laughing with Lottie. Jim thought he would never be able to be as tall or proud or heroic as Billy Negrey was to him. The day Pa had returned from the war, when President Lincoln said it was over and all the soldiers could go home, was the happiest day of Jim&#x2019;s young life. Even though Pa came back thin, and Momma fussed over him to eat more, and even though he had the eye patch and the headaches that came with it, that only made him seem more mysterious, more powerful, to Jim. <br>Lottie watched her father&#x2019;s face intently while he finished off the apple, nibbling all around the core <br>&#x201c;Was it Gen&#x2019;ral Pope that took away your eye?&#x201d; she asked. <br>Pa laughed. &#x201c;I reckon in a matter of speaking he did, my girl. Your old daddy didn&#x2019;t duck fast enough, and he took a bullet right in the eye. Don&#x2019;t complain, though. Other boys, they got it hundred times worse.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Pa, why does Mr. Campbell in town say you got a Chinaman&#x2019;s eye?&#x201d; Jim asked with a sheepish smile. <br>&#x201c;Now, James Matherson Negrey, you know good and well why.&#x201d; He looked from one eager face to the other and shook his head. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you two ever get tired of hearing this story?&#x201d; <br>They both shook their heads, and Billy laughed again. <br>&#x201c;Okay, okay. When I was serving with General Pope, my unit&#x2014;the First Infantry out of West Virginia&#x2014;we were in the middle of this big ol&#x2019; fight, y&#x2019;see&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bull Run? Right, Pa?&#x201d; Jim asked. He already knew the answer, and Billy knew he knew. <br>&#x201c;Yessir,&#x201d; Billy said. &#x201c;Second scrap we had on the same piece of land. Anyways, old General Pope, he made some pretty bad calculations and&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How bad, Pa?&#x201d; Lottie asked. <br>&#x201c;Darling, we were getting catawamptiously chawed up.&#x201d; <br>The children laughed, like they always did. <br>Billy continued. &#x201c;So the call comes for us to fall back, and that was when I&nbsp;&#x2026; when I got a Gardner right square in the eye. I was turning my head to see if old Luther Potts was falling back when it hit me. Turning my head probably saved my life.&#x201d; <br>Billy rubbed the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. <br>&#x201c;You all right, Pa?&#x201d; Jim asked. <br>&#x201c;Fine, Jim. Fetch me some water, will you? So, Lottie, where was I?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You got shot in the eye.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Right. So I don&#x2019;t recall much specific after that. I was in a lot of pain. I heard&nbsp;&#x2026; well, I could hear some of what was going on all around me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Like what, Pa?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;Never you mind. Anyways, someone grabbed me up, and dragged me for a spell, and finally I heard the sawbones telling someone to hold me still, and they did and I went to sleep for a long time. I dreamed about you and Jim and your mother. The stuff they give you to sleep makes you have funny dreams. I remember seeing someone all dressed up fancy in green silk, some kind of old man, but his hair was long like a woman&#x2019;s, and he was jawing at me, but I couldn&#x2019;t understand him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;When did you wake up, Pa?&#x201d; Jim asked. Even though he knew the story by heart, he always tried to flesh it out with any new details that he could glean from the retelling. <br>&#x201c;Few days later in a hospital tent. My head hurt bad and it was kind of hard to think or hear.&#x201d; Billy paused and seemed to wince. Jim handed him the wooden ladle full of cool water. He gulped it down and blinked a few times with his good eye. &#x201c;They told me we had fallen back and were on our way to Washington for garrison duty. General Pope was in a powerful lot of trouble too. <br>&#x201c;They told me I had lost the eye, but was mighty lucky to be alive. I didn&#x2019;t feel too lucky right that minute, but compared to all the lads who didn&#x2019;t come home at all, I figure I did have an angel on my shoulder.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So tell us about the Chinaman, Pa!&#x201d; Lottie practically squealed. <br>Billy winced but went on, with a for...</p><h2>Sin Killer: A Novel (Berrybender Narratives)</h2><p>From Pulitzer Prize-winning author Larry McMurtry comes the first in a four-volume epic journey through the early American frontier, featuring the Berrybender family, English nobility adrift in the American West in the 1830s.<br><br>It is 1830, and the Berrybender family&#x2014;rich, aristocratic, English, and hopelessly out of place&#x2014;is on its way up the Missouri River to see the untamed West as it begins to open up. With irascible determination&#x2014;and a great deal of outright chaos&#x2014;the party experiences both the awesome majesty and brutal savagery of the unexplored land, from buffalo stampedes and natural disasters to Indian raids and encounters with frontiersmen and trappers, explorers, pioneers, and one part-time preacher known as "the Sin Killer." Packed with breathtaking adventure, charming romance, and a sense of humor stretching clear over the horizon, Sin Killer is a truly unique view of the West that could only come from the boundless skill and imagination of Larry McMurtry.</p><p>Larry McMurtry's <i>Sin Killer</i> is a wildly entertaining ride through the untamed Great Plains. The first installment of a proposed tetralogy, The Berrybender Narratives, <i>Sin Killer</i> follows the adventures of the Berrybenders, a large, noble English family traveling the Missouri River in 1832. This deeply self-absorbed and spoiled family leaves England for the unknown of the American West, based solely on a "whim" and Lord Berrybender's desire to "shoot different animals from those he shot at home." The novel joins the family as they make their way toward Yellowstone aboard a luxury steamer, accompanied by a motley assemblage of servants, guides, and natives. Along the way, this "floating Europe" and its bickering, stubborn passengers encounter constant adversity, including warring natives, hellacious weather, accidental deaths, and kidnappings. <p> Thanks largely to <i>Sin Killer</i>'s gallery of colorful personalities, McMurtry keeps most of the action firmly in the realm of fish-out-of-water farce. One such character is the independent and opinionated eldest daughter Tasmin, who, frustrated by her family's conventions, escapes the steamer, whereupon she meets and falls in love with Jim Snow, a.k.a. Sin Killer. Snow, an Indian killer raised by natives, is a stoical, God-fearing man who won't tolerate blasphemy. With prose that flows as naturally as the Missouri, McMurtry weaves together a large cast and vast setting into a thoroughly exciting, hilarious adventure novel. Though <i>Sin Killer</i> focuses on a love story and contains plenty of realistic violence, McMurtry's efficient voice and matter-of-fact perspective leaves little room for tragedy or sentimentality, instead emphasizing high comedy. This is wonderful storytelling from a narrator in perfect agreement with his subject. <i>Sin Killer</i> should please McMurtry's many fans, who now have much to look forward to. <i>--Ross Doll</i></p>Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays.

P. Cavafy: Collected Poems</h2><p><p>C. P. Cavafy (1863-1933) lived in relative obscurity in Alexandria, and a collected edition of his poems was not published until after his death. Now, however, he is regarded as the most important figure in twentieth-century Greek poetry, and his poems are considered among the most powerful in modern European literature. Here is an extensively revised edition of the acclaimed translations of Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard, which capture Cavafy's mixture of formal and idiomatic use of language and preserve the immediacy of his frank treatment of homosexual themes, his brilliant re-creation of history, and his astute political ironies. The resetting of the entire edition has permitted the translators to review each poem and to make alterations where appropriate.

About the first edition: "The best [English version] we are likely to see for some time."--James Merrill, <i>The New York Review of Books</i> "[Keeley and Sherrard] have managed the miracle of capturing this elusive, inimitable, unforgettable voice.

In this book Martin Crawford gives comprehensive advice on all types of perennial vegetables (edible plants that live longer than three years) including coppiced trees, aquatic plants and edible woodland species. There are many advantages to growing perennial vegetables, for example: they need less tillage than conventionally grown vegetables, so the soil structure is not distrubed in their cultivation and carbon is retailed int he soil. They extend the harvesting season, especially in early spring; they are often of more value to beneficial insects than are annual vegetables; many perennial vegetables contain higher levles of mineral nutrients than annuals.</p><p><p><b>Martin Crawford</b> has spent more than 20 years in organic agriculture and horticulture, and is director of the Agroforestry Research Trust, a nonprofit charity that researches temperate agroforestry and all aspects of plant cropping and uses, with a focus on tree, shrub, and perennial crops.

Michael Oakeshott believed, as Timothy Fuller observes, that &#x201c;the historian&#x2019;s effort to understand the past without ulterior motive [is the] effort which distinguishes the historian as historian from all who examine the past for the guidance they expect it to provide about practical concerns.&#x201d; The essays on history are &#x201c;Present, Future, and Past,&#x201d; &#x201c;Historical Events: The fortuitous, the causal, the similar, the correlative, the analogous, and the contingent,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Historical Change: Identity and continuity.&#x201d; In &#x201c;The Rule of Law,&#x201d; Oakeshott takes the expression to mean a particular kind of ideal human relationship.

Both tragedies and magnificent gestures are chronicled here--from the terrifying forced march in 1942 to the heroic voluntary confinement of those dying of typhoid to the moving clandestine ordination of a young German deacon by a French bishop.

On account of his deep mystical experiences and constant absorption in God, Sri Ramakrishna (1836 - 1886) is regarded as being of the stature of Krishna, Buddha, and Christ. The Gospel is the record of his conversations, which are unique in their breadth and depth. Profound spiritual truths are here described in simple words and vivid stories, revealing the divinity of man and the spiritual foundation of the universe. <p>This abridged edition of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna (ISBN 0-911206-01-9) will be found useful for daily devotional reading and especially convenient to carry. The original work has been reduced by the Swami Nikhilananda to less than one-third of the its size by eliminating repetitions and unfamiliar references. This has been done without affecting the continuity or the completeness of the teaching. This 640 page edition retains the biographical introduction from the unabridged edition, as well as, a glossary, and index.</p></p><p>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna is published by The Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York which bases it teachings on the principles of Vedanta, or Hinduism. Hinduism teaches that every soul is potentially divine, and that its divinity may be manifested through worship, contemplation, unselfish work, and philosophical discrimination. According to Hinduism, Truth is universal and all humankind and all existence are one. It preaches the unity of the Godhead, or ultimate Reality, and accepts every faith as a valid means for its own followers to realize the Truth. For more information about the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York, visit www.ramakrishna.org.Sri Ramakrishna (A.D. 1836-1886) practised various religious austerities both within and outside Hinduism and experienced the fundamental truths which are the basis of all religions. Attracted by his irresistible power, men and women of all classes came to him - young and old, educated and illiterate, agnostic and orthodox; and they learned about many of the intimate truths of God revealed to this sensitive and disciplined mystic. His soul-stirring conversations, in simple words and vivid stories, were recorded with almost stenographic precision by one of his disciples and later published in an English translation. They bring a conviction of the divinity of man and the spiritual foundation of the universe, and an unusually deep and broad understanding of the essential harmony of religions. From the pages of this book Sri Ramakrishna emerges as a man of exceeding charm - winsome, loving, lovable, and completely God-intoxicated. Readers will feel that if God were to take human form and talk to us, this is what he would be like. <p>The present volume, a reprint of Ramakrishna: Prophet of New India, enlarged and thoroughly revised, is one third the length of the original work. It has lost none of the latter's simple beauty and structural unity. The book is especially designed for daily devotional study.</p></p><h2>Homebrew Beyond the Basics: All-Grain Brewing &amp; Other Next Steps</h2><p><b>Make your next beer your best beer with this revised and expanded version of the popular guide to homebrewing.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Want to take total control of the beer-making process?

In many respects this Algonquin tribe created the template by which the modern city that emerged was designed. Broadway, which followed the high ridge of the island, was the Mohican Trail; Routes 80 and 78 were ancient pilgrimage trails, Greenwich Village was an actual Indian village that stood on the banks of Manetta Creek.New Yorkers love their city-but how well do they know it? A thousand years before Columbus, the area that is now New York City was a thriving paradise, hilly and green, lush with forests and wildlife-and very much inhabited by the original Native New Yorkers: the spiritually and ecologically advanced Lenape Indians, part of the great Algonquin nation. Contemporary New Yorkers' footsteps-and their subways, ferries, and bridges-trace many of the identical paths and trails the Lenape used. In many respects, the Lenape created the template by which the city was designed: Broadway, which followed the high ridge of the island, was the Mohican Trail; Routes 80 and 78 out of the city are both ancient pilgrimage trails. Greenwich Village was an actual Indian village that stood on the banks of Manetta Creek, whose waters, named for a legendary monster, still run beneath the city; Bowling Green was the site of a sacred council fire and council elm; a vast Lenape cherry orchard once existed at the corner of Franklin Square and Cherry Street. <p>The accomplishments of New York's Algonquin population have gone almost completely unnoticed in the history books. Native New Yorkers corrects this omission by documenting the geography, population, philosophy, fashion, customs, ecology, spirituality, diplomatic ability, and the several beautiful and poetic languages of the Algonquin peoples in New York City, Long Island, and the Hudson River Valley-to present the clearest and most complete picture yet of exactly what life was like in New York before Europeans arrived. </p><p>The Lenape, whose relationship with the earth was one of stewardship, not ownership-they believed that "we belong to the earth"-considered themselves sacred land keepers, in this life and from the spirit world. Though they lived off the land in great numbers, they maintained a pristine ecological system-walking so gently on the land they left no impact, down to lining their graves not with stone, but tree bark. The intricate, metaphoric languages they spoke, described by an early Dutch observer as "sweet and full of meaning," reflected and colored their holistic worldview. The experiential and relational Algonquin languages lacked the distancing article "the," which prevents intimacy and blocks emotion. They had no word for "good-bye," only "see you again," because there is no final parting, even in death: we are all part of a great and endless circle of being. </p><p>Native New Yorkers also explains what became of the first Manhattanites. Removed by treaty at least twenty times, their history was suppressed, their language driven out of them and their New York settlements "cartographically submerged." Yet their movement west may be traced by the major cities they founded along their way and, as part of the group that came to be called the Delaware, they produced some of the most influential figures in frontier history. </p><p>Drawing on a wide range of historical sources as well as extensive interviews with living Algonquin elders; exhaustively tracing ancient trails, villages, burial grounds, and sacred sites; the text is supplemented with maps, a timeline of New York's Algonquin history, a glossary of Algonquin words, and a transcript of Giovanni da Verrazzano's letter to King Francis I of France describing his first glimpses of the people and landscape of New York in 1524. </p><p>For those who wish to glimpse the pastoral parallel universe beneath the concrete and skyscrapers; for lovers of New York, born and raised or distant; Native New Yorkers offers a comprehensive and fascinating account of the graceful Algonquin civilization that once flourished in the area that is now New York.</p></p><h2>The Path of Blessing: Experiencing the Energy and Abundance of the Divine</h2><p><p><b>Enrich your spiritual practice with a deeper understanding of Hebrew blessing. </b></p> <p> A Hebrew blessing is a powerful thing&#x2015;a short, deeply meditative exercise exploring the nature of God and the dynamic relationship between God, human consciousness and the unfolding universe. </p> <p> Written in clear, illuminating prose, this book will guide you through the opening words of a Hebrew blessing&#x2015;six words which embody the depth of Jewish spirituality&#x2015;revealing how the letters and words combine to promote joy and appreciation, wonder and thankfulness, amazement and praise. Each word becomes an invitation to discover the Presence of God flowing through even the smallest actions of our lives. </p> <p><b> Examine the deeper meaning behind: </b></p> <ul><li>Barukh Ata Adonay Eloheynu Melekh Ha&#x2019;Olam </li></ul> <p> In the ancient language of the Jewish mystical tradition and the modern language of hasidism, creation theology and psychology, <i>The Path of Blessing </i>brings the words of the Hebrew invocation dramatically alive. </p></p><p>I've always been fascinated by the individual sounds of languages and how the shape of each letter reveals its intrinsic meaning. So when I met Rabbi Marcia Prager and heard of the work she had done meditating on each letter of the <i>alephbet</i> and exploring its relationship to the adjoining letters in a word, I was hooked. Rabbi Marcia is a charismatic speaker who brings light and clarity into the room when she teaches. To reproduce this dynamic quality in a book was a real challenge but together I think we did it. As Reb Zalman Schachter, the father of the Jewish Renewal movement says in his praise of <b>The Path of Blessing</b>, "In times past, rabbis were traditionally called upon to give their imprimatur to new works of sacred teaching. While this is no longer the custom, I would like to set such an imprimatur on Rabbi Marcia's work. This is to emphasize that you are not merely reading a book but studying Torah."<br> --Toinette Lippe, Editorial Director, Bell Tower<br>In Praise of the Path of Blessing<br><br>"Marcia Prager gives voice to the the urgings of the Shekhinah, the feminine aspect of God.

Schachter-Shalomi, Aleph Alliance for Jewish Renewal, and World Wisdom Chair, Naropa Institut<br><br>"A rich, wise, and joyous book! Marcia Prager offers us an exhilarating adventure of the spirit.

She draws from a deep well of talmudic and hasidic teachings to illuminate a vast array of mystical treasures that can be gleaned from a few essential Hebrew words. This gem of a book is essential for anyone interested in spiritual Judaism."<br>--Rabbi David Cooper, author of God Is a Verb<br><br>"For many years the beauty of Rabbi Marcia Prager's teaching and prayer has been a blessing in my life. Now, many more will learn the power of her Jewish wisdom and how to use it in their lives.

But six long months ago, when Stanley's sense of honor required that he do as he had sworn and return to the Continent to fight in defense of King and country, neither Stanley nor Marjie could have dreamed what the cost of his service would be.</p> <p>It has been ages since Stanley last wrote, and Marjie and the Jonquil family are plagued by his unknown fate&#x2014;until the day he unexpectedly reappears. Marjie's joy, however, is quickly shadowed by confusion&#x2014;the aloof, battle-worn soldier before her is not the man he once was. In the wake of Stanley's blatant disinterest in renewing their acquaintance, Marjie's devastation turns to determination as she vows to help him find peace. But his scars run far deeper than anyone realizes. Despite his feelings for her, Stanley believes Marjie deserves a man whose hands are not stained with the violence of battlefields and whose mind and heart are not haunted by the horrors he has seen.</p> <p>Honor requires Stanley to return once more to the life he has grown to despise, one he knows will destroy him in the end, even as his heart beckons him to stay with Marjie, the only woman he could ever love, and the promise, at last, of redemption.</p></p><p></p><h2>A History of Art History</h2><p><p><b>An authoritative history of art history from its medieval origins to its modern predicaments</b></p><p>In this wide-ranging and authoritative book, the first of its kind in English, Christopher Wood tracks the evolution of the historical study of art from the late middle ages through the rise of the modern scholarly discipline of art history.

In it Spinoza discusses at length the historical circumstances of the composition and transmission of the Bible, demonstrating the fallibility of both its authors and its interpreters. He argues that free enquiry is not only consistent with the security and prosperity of a state but actually essential to them, and that such freedom flourishes best in a democratic and republican state in which individuals are left free while religious organizations are subordinated to the secular power. His Treatise has profoundly influenced the subsequent history of political thought, Enlightenment &#39;clandestine&#39; or radical philosophy, Bible hermeneutics, and textual criticism more generally.

The true structure and workings of the human body are, we casually assume, everywhere the same, a universal reality. But then we look into the past, and our sense of reality wavers: accounts of the body in diverse medical traditions often seem to describe mutually alien, almost unrelated worlds. The Expressiveness of the Body meditates on the contrasts between the human body described in classical Greek medicine and the body as envisaged by physicians in ancient China. It asks how this most basic of human realities came to be conceived by two sophisticated civilizations in radically diverging ways. And it seeks answers in fresh and unexpected topics, such as the history of tactile knowledge, the relationship between ways of seeing and ways of listening, and the evolution of bloodletting.</p></p><p>What are our bodies trying to tell us? In the scholarly yet delicately beautiful <i>The Expressiveness of the Body</i>, Japanese scholar Shigehisa Kuriyama examines two widely divergent traditions of diagnostic examination: Greek and Chinese. While at first glance it would seem that this would entail a straightforward familiar vs. exotic dichotomy for Western readers, only a short way into the book we realize that the ancient Greeks were just as foreign to us as the ancient Chinese. While there is some greater resemblance to modern medicine in the works of Galen and his contemporaries, Kuriyama shows us that their struggle to "decode" the body's signals was just as arbitrary--and just as accurate--as works like the <i>Huangdi Neijing</i>.<p> Showing that the often dramatic differences between their attitudes about signs such as pulse, breath, and blood both developed from and informed deeper beliefs about the nature of the body, Kuriyama exposes the highly subjective artistry of medicine. Like the proverbial blind men feeling the different parts of the elephant, the ancients focused exclusively on one set of traits and signs and developed a complex theoretical framework around it. Well documented and handsomely illustrated, <i>The Expressiveness of the Body</i> pokes and prods into the space between precise anatomical knowledge and the understanding of <i>qi</i> flow to find the rest of the elephant beyond the trunk, legs, and tail. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Shigehisa Kuriyama is Associate Professor and Staff Researcher at the International Research Center for Japanese Studies.</p><h2>Statistics, Loose-leaf Print Companion: Unlocking the Power of Data - no Wileyplus</h2><p>Softbound copy given to instructors.

This introduction covers the whole spectrum of Chinese religious history, from the multi-faceted religious heritage of pre-modern China, to the practice of different religions in China today, as well as the spread and influence of Chinese religions throughout the world. </p> <p>Mario Poceski, an experienced teacher of Chinese religions, explores the three main traditions of Buddhism, Confucianism and Daoism, as well as the development of Western and popular religions in the region, such as Christianity and Islam. The book introduces students to the richness and diversity of Chinese religious life, pointing out mutual influences and intersections of the religions of the region, and how they interact with other elements of Chinese culture and society, including politics, literature and art. </p> <p>Illustrated throughout, the book also includes text boxes, summary charts, a glossary and a list of further reading to aid students&#x2019; understanding and revision.

Here, Ch�gyam Trungpa discusses bardo in a very different sense: as the peak experience of any given moment. Our experience of the present moment is always colored by one of six psychological states: the god realm (bliss), the jealous god realm (jealousy and lust for entertainment), the human realm (passion and desire), the animal realm (ignorance), the hungry ghost realm (poverty and possessiveness), and the hell realm (aggression and hatred). In relating these realms to the six traditional Buddhist bardo experiences, Trungpa provides an insightful look at the "madness" of our familiar psychological patterns and shows how they present an opportunity to transmute daily experience into freedom.</p><p>Ch�gyam Trungpa (1940&#x2013;1987)&#x2014;meditation master, teacher, and artist&#x2014;founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, the first Buddhist-inspired university in North America; the Shambhala Training program; and an international association of meditation centers known as Shambhala International. He is the author of numerous books including <i>Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior</i>, <i>Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism</i>, and <i>The Myth of Freedom</i>."The extended discussions are extremely illuminating . . . This is a deeply psychological book, in the sense that Trungpa Rinpoche exhorts us to come to grips with the psychology of our own minds in the most fundamental way."&#x2014; <i>Ordinary Mind </i></p><h2>Censored Science: The Suppressed Evidence</h2><p>Censored Science is a stunning designed, full-color book showcasing the fifty best evidences for a biblical creation worldview. Each two-page spread lays out the evidence for creation and then provides a rebuttal to the most common evolutionist objections to the evidence. Updated and expanded in 2014, the volume contains both the most recent cutting-edge evidence for creation and time-tested evidence which have never been answered by those rejecting Biblical truth. The book is divided into three major sections - Censored Biological Evidence, Censored Geological Evidence, and Censored Cosmological Evidence. Each section starts with a description of how an assumption of naturalism prevents our educational system from exposing students to any evidence which contradicts the presuppositions of evolution. Every page is a visual masterpiece, mating original photography or graphic designs with compelling text. Rather than a simple presentation of facts, Censored Science draws the reader into each subject using stories, analogies, and illustrations of the relevance for each of the evidences for creation. This coffee table quality hardback is the kind of book anyone would be proud to give to others. It has been technically reviewed and endorsed by some of the top scientists involved in creation research - including Dr. Steve Austin, Dr. John Baumgardner, and Dr. John Sanford.</p><p><p>Bruce Malone has a degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati and has worked as a research leader for Dow Chemical for 28 years. He holds 18 patents with the company and has a clear understanding of how science works. Bruce left Dow in 2008 to lead Search for the Truth Ministries with the goal of &#x201c;Opening heart and minds to biblical truth&#x201d;. Bruce has lectured extensively on the evidence supporting Biblical creation and has published 6 books on the subject with over 200,000 copies in print. Censored Science was written to present the most startling and irrefutable evidence for creation in a compelling and visually stunning format. Over 50,000 books on the evidence for creation have been donated to students and prisoners in order to build the credibility of the Bible as a reliable source of truth within our culture.</p>Science is currently saturated by the belief that natural causes can explain everything. Yet all data must be interpreted. Observations and evidence cannot reveal truth without being placed within some framework of understanding. No amount of data or information is likely to change someone&#x2019;s mind if their starting assumption is a belief that everything must have a natural cause (i.e. no involvement by God). Even brilliant scientists can be blind to interpretations which do not agree with their presuppositions (starting assumptions). This book simply presents a number of startling observations which fit perfectly into a straightforward understanding of biblical truth but contradict the paradigm of evolution. Thus Censored Science provides an &#x201c;end run&#x201d; around the blockade of censorship within our education system, which only shows students naturalistic explanations for everything.<br> The visual imagery of this book is designed to draw the reader to the biblical truths of creation. Each page is akin to a tiny morsel of food, any one of which is unlikely to satisfy the hunger of someone starving for truth, but which, like a succulent appetizer, heightens the sense of hunger. Many pages reference phenomenal books which go into much greater technical depth; this is where the full meal can be obtained. Yet even appetizers can satisfy if enough are consumed. Taken as a whole, this book forms a smorgasbord for trusting God&#x2019;s Word as it relates to the real physical world around us. <br> Censored Science has taken three years from concept to publication, with the goal of making each page a visually stunning masterpiece. I hope those blinded by assumptions of naturalism may come to see the truth; those deafened by apathy will desire to reverberate reality to others; and those lamed by the hopelessness of evolution will walk in the liberation of knowing the Bible can be trusted.</p><h2>My Grandfather&#39;s Coat</h2><p><b>Sydney Taylor Award Winner<br><br>"A moving tale of love and regeneration." --<i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>When my grandfather came to America <br>he made himself a handsome coat!<br>Then he wore it and he wore it and he wore it--<br>until it was all worn out!<br>So what did he do?<br><br><i>He snipped and he clipped--<br> and he stitched and he sewed. . .<br> and out of the still-good cloth of his coat--<br>he made himself a smart jacket!</i><br><br>How many things can Grandfather make<br>out of that old frayed coat?<br><br>Jim Aylesworth's satisfying retelling and Barbara McClintock's heart-warming pictures celebrate the clever recycling of a beloved coat that lasts four generations -- until it becomes this story!</p><p>Jim Aylesworth tells his stories with generous doses of "out loud" sounds, rhythms, and rhymes. His twenty-five-year teaching career taught him exactly what children love best in a story. He lives in Chicago, Illinois, with his wife.<br>Barbara McClintock has written and/or illustrated over forty distinguished books for children, including <i>My Grandfather's Coat</i>, retold by Jim Aylesworth, which received three starred reviews, and her own highly acclaimed Adele and Simon books. Her books have five times been named <i>New York Times</i> Best Illustrated Children&#x2019;s Books. She has received a Boston Globe-Horn Book Honor, as well as a myriad of other awards and honors. Barbara lives in Connecticut with her family and two very graceful cats.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;This new adaptation of the Yiddish folk song presented in Simms Taback's Joseph Had a Little Overcoat (Viking, 1999) and Phoebe Gilman's Something from Nothing (Scholastic, 1992) is a fresh rhythmic retelling with charming cartoon-style illustrations that deserves a place even in collections that own the other two. Aylesworth's story, told in the voice of the main character's granddaughter, recounts highlights of her grandfather's life: coming to America, becoming a tailor, and making himself "a handsome coat...that he wore on his wedding day!" The worn coat becomes "a smart jacket"; the shabby jacket, "a snazzy vest"; the frayed vest, "a stylish tie." In this version, the threadbare tie is transformed into a toy for a great grandson's kittens, then a cozy nest for a mouse and her babies. As in both older versions, this one features repetition and a rhyming refrain. McClintock's pen-and-ink detailed watercolor illustrations highlight four generations of family history. Following the title-page scene that shows ships streaming toward Ellis Island, then a photolike pose of grandfather as a boy on deck passing the Statue of Liberty, the story unfolds in two-to-three small vignettes per page, each accompanied by a snippet of text, with a full-page scene at each major juncture. The paintings highlight McClintock's special skill for aging grandpa. Her eye for detail is apparent in ever-changing clothing styles; in a sole coming loose from young grandpa's shoe; and the evolution of his sewing machines from treadle to modern motorized. This is a tale worth reading again and again.&#x2014;Susan Scheps, formerly at Shaker Public Library, OH</p><h2>Grace in Practice: A Theology of Everyday Life</h2><p><i>Grace in Practice</i>&nbsp;is a challenging call to live life under grace -- a concept most Christians secretly have trouble with. Paul Zahl pulls no punches, contending that no matter how often we talk about salvation by grace, in our "can-do" society we often cling instead to a righteousness of works. Asserting throughout that grace always trumps both law and church, Zahl illuminates an expansive view of grace in everything, extending the good news of grace to all creation. Conversationally written and filled with fascinating insights,&nbsp;<i>Grace in Practice</i>&nbsp;will reward any Christian who seeks to understand the full measure of God's grace and the total freedom it offers.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Paul F M Zahl is Dean and President of Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry, Pennsylvania. He is the author of several books including The First Christian.<b><i>Aspiring Retail</i></b><br> "Using Scripture, fiction, contemporary and classic movies, and other sources, Zahl demonstrates God's grace as the only hope for humanity, and shows how it can be practiced in common, everyday situations. Recommended."<br><br><b><i>First Things</i></b><br> "Zahl's newest and best book,&nbsp;<i>Grace in Practice</i>, is a fascinating, sometimes brilliant, and deeply pastoral attempt to work out [the] theology of grace as a universal principle for Christian doctrine and life."<br><br><b>Peter J. Gomes</b><br> &#x2014; Harvard University<br> "Paul Zahl is at it again ? and, as usual, for the good of us all. He has been 'long on grace and short on law' for all of his ministry, and who in these difficult times could want&nbsp;<i>more</i>&nbsp;law and less grace? This is a book for everyday believers ? an act of grace."<br><br><b>Geiko M�ller-Fahrenholz</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>America's Battle for God</i><br> "Zahl's&nbsp;<i>Grace in Practice</i>&nbsp;cuts right across the patterns of thinking and acting to which Christians have become accustomed. An engaging and passionate book, intensely personal, witty and direct ? and provocative to the core."<br><br><b>J. Ligon Duncan III</b><br> &#x2014; President, Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals<br> "Paul Zahl is a formidable scholar, an admired colleague, and a courageous churchman, but I especially love Paul Zahl the preacher ? his passion and humor, his power of description and illustration, and, above all, his zeal for grace. When he speaks about law and grace, I'm totally caught up in it ? even when he's beating up on my views! That same enthusiasm comes through in this book. Cascading pop-culture references are flanked with the profoundest of insights. A barrage of illustrations brings home Zahl's message. Martin Luther has his spokesman. In&nbsp;<i>Grace in Practice</i>, Zahl sets out a theology of the reality, experience, and expression of grace in the Christian life ? and then doesn't mind upsetting your applecart as he applies it specifically to just about everything."</p><h2>Monster in the Closet (The Baltimore Series)</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Every Dark Corner</i> returns to Baltimore, where a father-daughter reunion puts innocent victims in the sights of a stone-cold killer...</b><br><br>Baltimore PI Clay Maynard routinely locates missing children for clients, but his own daughter&#x2014;stolen by his ex-wife&#x2014;has eluded him for years.

But just as Taylor feels her life opening up to new family, work, and friends, a danger lurks in the darkness&#x2014;one that will show Taylor the face of true evil...</p><p><b>Karen Rose</b>&nbsp;is the award-winning, #1 international bestselling author of some twenty novels, including the bestselling Baltimore and Cincinnati&nbsp;series. She has been translated into twenty-three languages and her books have placed on the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>, the&nbsp;<i>Sunday Times&nbsp;</i>(UK), and Germany&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>der Spiegel</i>&nbsp;bestseller lists.<b><b><p>Chapter One</p><p><b><i>Hunt Valley, Maryland Saturday, August 22, 12:50 p.m.</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Heels down, Janie.&#x201d; Taylor Dawson stood in the middle of the training ring, focused on the five-year-old girl sitting astride what was the most gentle, patient horse Taylor had ever known. Janie&#x2019;s back, already too stiff and rigid, tightened further, her little hands clenching the reins as a frown thinned her lips.</p><p>Taylor knew the child&#x2019;s frown was not directed at her, but almost wished it were. A perfectionist in little zebra cowboy boots, Janie was angry with herself. Angry that she&#x2019;d had to be corrected by anyone. That she wasn&#x2019;t already perfect.</p><p>Taylor swallowed a sigh. <i>Been there, done that</i>. Looking quickly to her right, she met the worried eyes of Janie&#x2019;s big sister, who stood on the other side of the fence, watching Janie with an eagle eye. Taylor gave the girl an encouraging smile. Jazzie did not smile back, her expression a mix of poorly hidden desperation and stoic determination. At eleven years old, she&#x2019;d become her little sister&#x2019;s keeper. Her protector. Her staunchly silent protector.</p><p>Because Jazzie Jarvis had not spoken a single word, not in the two weeks Taylor had been interning for �Healing Hearts with Horses. According to Maggie VanDorn, Taylor&#x2019;s boss, Jazzie hadn&#x2019;t spoken in the two weeks before that, either&#x2014;not since finding her mother&#x2019;s broken body in a pool of her own blood, her face nearly unrecognizable.</p><p><i>It&#x2019;ll be okay,</i> Taylor wanted to promise. <i>For both of you</i>. But she couldn&#x2019;t promise that. Nobody could. Janie and Jazzie had been through a hell no child should ever endure.</p><p>Taylor suppressed a shudder. How did anyone come back from that? Adults didn&#x2019;t come back from that kind of trauma. How could two little motherless girls begin to cope? To heal?</p><p>But if it could happen anywhere, it was here. Healing Hearts with Horses had been providing therapy to traumatized children for over a year now and already had a slew of success stories. Taylor knew this because she&#x2019;d very thoroughly researched the program, including its founder/president, Daphne Montgomery-Carter, <i>and</i> her staff, before submitting her application.</p><p>In addition to her philanthropy, Daphne was a full-time prosecutor for the city of Baltimore. Somehow she managed to raise money for the program in her &#x201c;spare time,&#x201d; lending a hand to the therapy sessions whenever she could. All the day-to-day details were left to Maggie VanDorn, an accomplished horsewoman and licensed therapist who had years of experience working with child victims of violent crime.</p><p>Janie and Jazzie had a good chance for recovery here&#x2014;if they&#x2019;d let themselves relax and have a little fun. Getting Janie to actually breathe while on her horse would be a good start, but telling new riders to remember to breathe often made them even more stressed.</p><p>Getting Janie to sing would get her to breathe without her knowing she was doing it.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Janie!&#x201d; Taylor called. &#x201c;Did you know that Ginger likes music?&#x201d;</p><p>Janie turned her head to stare at Taylor suspiciously. &#x201c;Horses don&#x2019;t like music.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ginger does. She loves it when I sing to her. Especially when I&#x2019;m riding her. She just chills out like you&#x2019;re giving her a massage.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t exactly true, but it wasn&#x2019;t necessarily a lie, either.</p><p>Taylor was good at telling not-exactly-truths that also weren&#x2019;t lies. She&#x2019;d perfected the skill at the feet of the master of lies and deceit. <i>Thanks for that, Mom</i>.</p><p>Pushing her own bitterness aside, she smiled at Janie. &#x201c;Do you know any songs?&#x201d;</p><p>A wary nod, but no reply, which was no surprise. Unlike Jazzie, who&#x2019;d remained mute, Janie did speak sometimes. Their files said that Jazzie had been shy before their mother&#x2019;s murder because she had a painful stutter, but Janie had been a champion talker, never meeting a silence she couldn&#x2019;t fill. Now Janie was withdrawn, her communication reduced to sentences of four or five words. <i>Well, duh</i>. Who wouldn&#x2019;t be withdrawn?</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know &#x2018;The Wheels on the Bus&#x2019;?&#x201d; Taylor asked and grinned when Janie rolled her eyes. It was a beautifully normal gesture from a kid who&#x2019;d forgotten how to behave like a child.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s for babies,&#x201d; Janie said sullenly.</p><p><i>And you&#x2019;re oh-so-old,</i> Taylor thought sadly, but forced her lips to remain curved. &#x201c;Fair enough. How about &#x2018;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,&#x2019; then? Do you know that one?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Janie muttered. &#x201c;Everybody does.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. Help me out, then. Let&#x2019;s make Ginger happy.&#x201d; Taylor began singing the song loudly and off-key, because the universe had not gifted her with any musical ability. She made it through the song once solo while Ginger patiently plodded around the training ring, Janie still rigid as a board. The second time, though, Janie began to sing as well.</p><p>Taylor didn&#x2019;t ask any more questions, immediately launching into &#x201c;You Are My Sunshine,&#x201d; hoping Janie knew that one, too, gratified when the little girl followed her lead. After the second time through that song, Taylor began to see the desired effect. Janie&#x2019;s shoulders softened, her posture relaxing a fraction. She was singing with a studied focus, like she did everything else, so she wasn&#x2019;t enjoying it, but she was breathing and that was a good start.</p><p>Taylor searched her mind for the songs she&#x2019;d sung with the kids at the campus day care where she&#x2019;d volunteered as an undergrad, quickly eliminating all those that were violent&#x2014;like the old woman who swallowed a fly and eventually died&#x2014;or those that mentioned a mommy and came up with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>Nada. Shit</i>.</p><p>But Janie solved the problem herself, filling the silence with a gritty, muttered, angry version of &#x201c;Let It Go.&#x201d; <i>Thank you, Disney,</i> Taylor thought.</p><p>She heard the gate open and close, the footsteps behind her too heavy to belong to Jazzie, who was too afraid of the horses to approach them anyway. It was Maggie VanDorn, then. The manager of the program was an efficient older woman with a big heart and years of experience in social work. Maggie pressed a cold bottle of water into Taylor&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Good thinking, getting her to sing,&#x201d; Maggie murmured.</p><p>Taylor&#x2019;s lips curved at the praise. She&#x2019;d learned that Maggie never said anything she didn&#x2019;t mean. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s still not enjoying herself, but she&#x2019;s breathing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Joy takes time.&#x201d; Maggie sighed. &#x201c;Lots of time. And speaking of time, Janie&#x2019;s session is over and you need to take a break. You&#x2019;ve done four sessions back-to-back and it&#x2019;s time to get out of the sun for a while.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; Taylor said dryly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m from California, remember? I grew up in the sun.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Be that as it may, take a break,&#x201d; Maggie insisted. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to have to replace you because you got heatstroke. Your face is redder than my heirloom tomatoes.&#x201d;</p><p>Taylor put up her hands in surrender. &#x201c;Okay, okay.&#x201d; She drank most of the bottle of water, then splashed the rest in her face. It <i>was</i> hot here, she had to admit, a lot hotter than back home in Northern California, where the temps rarely climbed above eighty year-round and the humidity was nonexistent. This suburb of Baltimore had been eighty degrees by breakfast and the high was supposed to be ninety-nine. The air was so muggy, she was beginning to wish she had gills.</p><p>&#x201c;Let me get Janie down and cleaned up,&#x201d; Taylor said. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll take her and Jazzie back to their aunt.&#x201d; The aunt whose eyes were a constant mix of grief and fear and fury.</p><p>Lilah Cornell had lost her sister and gained responsibility for her two nieces all in the same day. A former prosecutor who&#x2019;d worked with Daphne, she was now on the fast track in the attorney general&#x2019;s office, which meant she worked long hours, nearly seven days a week.</p><p>All that had abruptly changed when her sister was murdered, but no one on the farm had heard her complain. Lilah did have help, at least. The girls&#x2019; father was no longer in the picture, but his mother, their grandmother, had been living with Janie and Jazzie at the time of the murder. Grandma Eunice had watched the girls while her daughter-in-law was at work. After the murder, she&#x2019;d moved with them to Aunt Lilah&#x2019;s posh but very small apartment, which had been a major adjustment for all of them. Maggie had mentioned that Lilah was looking for a bigger place, which only added to the little family&#x2019;s general stress.</p><p>But both Lilah and Eunice seemed to be good women who loved the girls. Lilah accompanied them for their Saturday therapy sessions while Grandma Eunice brought them during the week.</p><p>Taylor pointed at the farmhouse, to the large window that provided a view of the training ring&#x2014;complete with audio courtesy of discreetly placed microphones. &#x201c;Lilah&#x2019;s waiting in the lounge.&#x201d;</p><p>Daphne and Maggie had converted the dining room of the farmhouse to a sitting area where parents and guardians could monitor their kids. Healing Hearts was all about transparency. The program prided itself on making the children and the adults feel safe.</p><p>Maggie&#x2019;s nod was briskly approving. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care of Ginger. She&#x2019;s done for the day. We&#x2019;ll use Gracie for lessons this afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Taylor approached Ginger and Janie, smiling when she heard the little girl still singing softly. Janie had released her iron hold on the reins and was stroking Ginger&#x2019;s neck.</p><p>No smile bent Janie&#x2019;s lips, but the little stress lines around her mouth had disappeared. No child should have stress lines. But kids like Janie did. <i>So did I. I still do</i>.</p><p>Taylor cleared her throat. &#x201c;Ginger likes you.&#x201d;</p><p>A solemn nod. No words of reply, just a look of bruised exhaustion in Janie&#x2019;s eyes, like she was so tired of being scared but had resigned herself to it. Taylor recognized that look, too. She&#x2019;d seen it in the mirror often enough.</p><p>&#x201c;Time to dismount and get a cold drink, okay?&#x201d; Taylor held her hands out, ready to catch the child if she fell, but Janie executed a flawless dismount then stood motionless for a few hard heartbeats, staring up at Ginger. Then she stunned Taylor by throwing her arms around the horse&#x2019;s neck and leaning up to Ginger&#x2019;s ear.</p><p>&#x201c;I like you, too,&#x201d; Janie whispered.</p><p>Taylor quickly looked over her shoulder to Maggie, whose eyes held a satisfaction that was tender and fierce all at once, underscoring that Janie had made a breakthrough. <i>And I got to be here for it, </i>Taylor thought, her eyes stinging.</p><p>Taylor didn&#x2019;t delude herself into thinking that she&#x2019;d made the breakthrough with Janie. Maggie VanDorn had done all the work, really. But it didn&#x2019;t stop her from feeling a little of Maggie&#x2019;s satisfaction. This could get addictive. <i>Except that I&#x2019;m not going to stay.</i></p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t come to Maryland intending to actually work the full internship or even to stay more than a few days, but the Healing Hearts clientele had sucked her in more quickly and completely than she&#x2019;d anticipated. It was going to be hard to walk away once she&#x2019;d gotten what she&#x2019;d come for.</p><p><b><i>Baltimore, Maryland Saturday, August 22, 1:05 p.m.</i></b></p><p>Gage Jarvis snugged the tie against the collar of his crisp new shirt, nearly sighing at the feel of quality linen against his skin, of the silk tie between his fingers, all slippery smooth.</p><p>How long had it been since he&#x2019;d worn a tie?

Of course they&#x2019;d told everyone he&#x2019;d resigned to &#x201c;pursue other interests,&#x201d; but he&#x2019;d been fired, for doing the same damn thing every other lawyer in the firm did. Pretentious, sanctimonious, holier-than-thou assholes. <i>Judging me. Me. </i>He&#x2019;d been the top junior partner, had brought in more business than all the others. Almost put together. Which the partners had lauded, until Valerie made her little phone call to the cops. <i>Domestic violence.</i> The fucking bitch.</p><p>Hell, he hadn&#x2019;t even hurt her that bad that time, either. And he wasn&#x2019;t sorry. She&#x2019;d had it coming, like she always did. He could have hurt her a lot worse.</p><p>He could have done what he had done a month ago. Beaten her until she didn&#x2019;t get up. Ever again. <i>Shoulda killed her two years, nine months, and fourteen days ago. Would have saved everyone a whole lot of trouble.</i></p><p>She&#x2019;d recanted back then. Withdrawn her complaint. But it was too little, too late. The partners had ordered his office searched, had found his stash in his desk drawer. Hidden, of course, but they&#x2019;d found it easily enough because they hid their stashes in exactly the same place in their desk drawers.</p><p>So he&#x2019;d done a little coke. So what? So had everyone else. They needed it just to wake up because the hours were grueling, the competition fierce. Too many partner wannabes and too few positions. Fucking asshole senior partners had to retire or die before any of the slave-labor junior partners were given the proverbial key to the executive washroom. Because Stegner, Hall, and Kramer still had those keys and Gage had wanted one.</p><p>And he would have gotten it, if it hadn&#x2019;t been for Valerie&#x2019;s malicious lies. And her sister&#x2019;s, too. <i>Can&#x2019;t forget about Lilah</i>. No, he never would. Valerie would never have made that call to the police on her own. Lilah had made it for her.</p><p><i>Ruined my stupid, fucking life</i>. One of these days he&#x2019;d see his sister-in-law humiliated and cast out, just like she&#x2019;d had him ruined. But at least Valerie had been taken care of. That would have to be good enough. For now.</p><p><i>Because I&#x2019;m back.</i> Back to his city, ready to reclaim the life he&#x2019;d had. <i>No, not the life I had.</i> <i>A much better one.</i></p><p>Because he had a new job. A better one than he&#x2019;d had at the old firm. Soon he&#x2019;d have an expense account again and could wine and dine and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>He realized he was scowling into the dressing room&#x2019;s full-length mirror and abruptly smiled at himself. <i>That&#x2019;s better,</i> he thought, massively grateful that he&#x2019;d never done meth like the Romano kid had. Gage might have a few track marks and a bit of a sniffle, but his teeth were still nice.</p><p>He regarded his reflection with a satisfied nod. The suit, while not quite up to his old standards, was a giant leap above what he&#x2019;d been wearing for the last few years. It was a decent fit&#x2014;not great but not as bad as it would have been a month ago&#x2014;and the white shirt made his tanned skin look even darker. The tan he&#x2019;d come by honestly, courtesy of the two and a half years he&#x2019;d spent combing the beaches of Florida. It had helped him look&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not so dead. He&#x2019;d been gaunt there at the end. He was still too thin, but at least he didn&#x2019;t look like a walking corpse anymore.</p></b></b></p><h2>How to Raise Good Catholic Children</h2><p><p>First published fifty years ago, <em>How to Raise Good Catholic Children</em> is a rare treat for today's parents: a wise and readable book on child care that derives its wisdom from the Catholic home rather than from psychologists.</p> <p>Author Mary Reed Newland here draws on her own experiences as the mother of seven to show how the classic Christian principles of sanctity can be translated into terms easily applied to children even to the very young.</p> <p>Because it's rooted in experience, not in theory, nothing that Mrs. Newland suggests is impossible or extraordinary.

The book was assembled posthumously on the basis of two published sections, one written and recorded session, and one informal recorded session.<br><br>The book is at once an affectionate look back over the multiple roles played by animals in Derrida&#x2019;s work and a profound philosophical investigation and critique of the relegation of animal life that takes place as a result of the distinction&#x2015;dating from Descartes&#x2015;between man as thinking animal and every other living species. That starts with the very fact of the line of separation drawn between the human and the millions of other species that are reduced to a single &#x201c;the animal.&#x201d; Derrida finds that distinction, or versions of it, surfacing in thinkers as far apart as Descartes, Kant, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas, and he dedicates extended analyses to<br>the question in the work of each of them.<br><br>The book&#x2019;s autobiographical theme intersects with its philosophical analysis through the figures of looking and nakedness, staged in terms of Derrida&#x2019;s experience when his cat follows him into the bathroom in the morning. In a classic deconstructive reversal, Derrida asks what this animal sees and thinks when it sees this naked man. Yet the experiences of nakedness and shame also lead all the way back into the mythologies of &#x201c;man&#x2019;s dominion over the beasts&#x201d; and trace a history of how man has systematically displaced onto the animal his own failings or b�tises.<br><br>The Animal That Therefore I Am is at times a militant plea and indictment regarding, especially, the modern industrialized treatment of animals. However, Derrida cannot subscribe to a simplistic version of animal rights that fails to follow through, in all its implications, the questions and definitions of &#x201c;life&#x201d; to which he returned in much of his later work.</p></p><p>The late Jacques Derrida was the single most influential voice in European philosophy of the last quarter of the twentieth century. His Athens, Still Remains, The Animal That Therefore I Am, Sovereignties in Question, and Deconstruction in a Nutshell have been published by Fordham University Press.<br><br>MARIE-LOUIS MALLET has been a Program Director at the Coll�ge International de Philosophie and was the organizer of three of the four Derrida Cerisy conferences.

First, she asks you to imagine characters whose sexual identities and alliances shift constantly. Then she asks you to imagine that most of the characters make an impossible leap in time, from colonial Africa in the Victorian age to contemporary Britain. Lastly, she asks you to imagine some of the male characters played by women and some female characters played by men. Churchill likes to get things good and mixed up so all the audience&#39;s preconceptions about gender, romance, and &#34;lifestyle&#34; are scrambled, neutralized, and possibly even rebuilt. The title refers to the state of orgasmic and emotional bliss that everyone in this play seems to be striving for so desperately.Caryl Churchill (1938-) is probably the most respected woman dramatist in the English-speaking world.

Although various rock predecessors have examined spiritual issues--U2, Van Morrison, and Bob Dylan immediately come to mind--dc Talk has taken the notion to new lengths, both in commercial terms and depth of artistic exploration. Numerous Dove Awards, three Grammy Awards, two platinum albums, one gold album, and two gold-certified long-form videos attest to the group's ability to bridge the gap between religious and secular audiences. "We are very open about our Christian faith," says Toby McKeehan, "but when we make our records we want to create a musical experience that anyone can immerse themselves in. One of our goals is to encourage listeners to question themselves and to seek out truth."<br><br>Authoring the books in the JESUS FREAKS series is the newest venture in an ongoing growth process which began when the three members first met in the mid-1980s while attending college in Virginia. After relocating to Nashville, dc Talk released a series of increasingly ambitious-and successful-albums, beginning with their self-titled 1989 debut; followed by their gold-certified 1990 sophomore album Nu Thang; the platinum-certified 1992 opus Free at Last; 1995's Jesus Freak, a platinum-plus watershed which afforded the group more mainstream success than ever before; and 1998's Supernatural, which reflects the maturity and sophistication of their latest stage of development and growth. They have sold over seven million albums and have won four Grammys. <br><br>With Jesus Freaks and Jesus Freaks Volume II: Stories of Revolutionaries Who Changed Their World Fearing God, Not Man, they launch into a new media form to challege readers to question their standards of faith and dedication. By giving these stories a platform from which to be heard, they hope to impact the world in a way they never have before.<br>Whether forging strong bonds with concert audiences, expressing their faith in the recording studio, or confronting readers with no-compromise stories of commitment, dc Talk strives to treat their audiences as equals rather than receptors. McKeehan says,"We want to create art that encourages people to think about the things we think about-spiritual issues and truth." Max adds, "Just as we all share the idea of caring and conscience, we also share the hunger to find truth and meaning in life."<br><br>With Jesus Freaks Volume II, dc Talk once again encourages each of us to set out on our journey to discover our response to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Visit the Jesus Freaks Web site at jesusfreaks.net and the band Web site at dctalk.com</p><h2>Ghost Country</h2><p><p>&#x201c;In a word: Brilliant....It left me breathless and awed....Pure exhilaration from the first page to the last.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;James Rollins, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Altar of Eden</em></p><p>&#x201c;WOW!

But the family?s joy turns to despair when the baby is taken, and something <i>unnatural</i> is left in his place.

She graduated from the University of Otago with degrees in languages and music, and has had a varied career that includes teaching and performing music as well as working in government agencies. Juliet now lives in a hundred-year-old cottage near the river in Perth, Western Australia, where she writes full-time. She is a member of the druid order OBOD. Juliet shares her home with two dogs and a cat. Juliet&#39;s historical fantasy novels are published internationally and have won a number of awards.Returning to the land of the Sevenwaters trilogy (<i>Daughter of the Forest</i>, etc.), Marillier deftly weaves a fey story of human interaction with the Fair Folk. Clodagh, the third daughter of the lord of Sevenwaters, is the practical one who keeps things running while her aging mother awaits the birth of a male heir. At her sister's wedding, she meets rude, closed-off Cathal, one of her cousin Johnny's personal guards. Shortly after, when the Fair Folk replace the newborn heir with a changeling creature, Clodagh and Cathal put their lives and sanity on the line to rescue the child. Marillier's gripping tale of adventure and enduring love bobbles slightly at the start, mostly due to Clodagh's modern attitude and cadence, but slides quickly and assuredly into a grand tale of ancient Erin. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Such dual roles enacted in treatment include the unseeing, uninvolved parent and the unseen, neglected child; the sadistic abuser and the helpless, enraged victim; the idealized rescuer and the entitled child; and the seducer and the seduced.This is the first model for treatment of adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse that takes advantage of a relational approach and that integrates psychoanalytic thinking with the latest findings from the literature on psychological trauma and sexual abuse. Diverging from a more classical perspective, the authors view dissociation as the means by which a person adapts to and expresses traumatogenic material and by which such patients defend against traumatic memories, affects, and fantasy elaborations emerging into consciousness. The authors also detail how dissociation helps organize the patient&#39;s personality and presentation of self.Richly illustrated case examples bring to life the authors&#39; treatment model and show how clinicians can work through the relational paradigms between patient and therapist and, ultimately, reach the core of the patient&#39;s deeply buried experiences of self and other.</p><p><b>Jody Messler Davies, Ph.D.,</b> is a faculty member and clinical supervisor at the Derner Institute, Adelphi University, and at Columbia University's Teachers College.

Finally, in <i>Design-It-Yourself Clothes</i>, former Urban Outfitters designer Cal Patch brings her youthful aesthetic to a how-to book. If you want to wear something you can&#x2019;t find on store racks and make clothes that express your individual style, or if you&#x2019;ve reached a sewing plateau and want to add pattern drafting to your repertoire, <i>Design-It-Yourself Clothes</i> is the book you have been waiting for.<br><br>In five key projects (each with four variations)&#x2013;a perfect-fitting dress, T-shirt, button-down shirt, A-line skirt, and pants&#x2013;Patch shares the art of patternmaking. At its core, it&#x2019;s much simpler than you think. Patch covers everything an intermediate sewer needs to know in order to become a fabulous fashion designer, from designing the patterns, taking your own measurements, and choosing fabrics to actually sewing the clothing. You will also learn how to stylize patterns by using darts, waistbands, patch pockets, and ruffles. Patch offers tips, explanations, options, and exercises throughout that will make the design process that much easier. <i><br><br></i>But besides showing you how to create clothing from scratch, she also teaches you how to rub off patterns from existing clothing&#x2013;so if you have a pair of pants that you love but are worn out, or you have your eye on a piece in the store with a prohibitive price tag, you can figure out how to get the looks you want by using your own two hands.</p><p>CAL PATCH was a clothing designer for Urban Outfitters and Free People before creating her own label, Hodge Podge. She teaches sewing and patternmaking throughout New York City.</p><h2>Top 10 United Methodist Beliefs</h2><p>There can be no doubt about what Jesus thought was &#x201c;the main thing,&#x201d; the Great Commandments to love God with our heart, soul, and mind and to love neighbor as yourself.<br> <br> What were the non-negotiables for the founder of the Methodist movement, John Wesley? Wesley&#x2019;s first priority was to grow Christian disciples who loved God and neighbor with a holy love that keeps those Commandments.<br> <br> Using John Wesley as guide, <em>Top 10 United Methodist Beliefs</em> describes the 10 most important United Methodist beliefs, so that we are equipped for every good work. It also describes how a passionate Wesley can still inspire us to travel the road to perfection using these basic beliefs as signposts, not hitching posts, so that we can more fully follow Jesus.<br> <br> But discipleship can be arduous and God&#x2019;s grace is not cheap. We must be prepared to walk and walk and not just talk. The Christian life is action packed with surprises at every turn. &#x201c;Are you able?&#x201d; as the old hymn asks. Yes, Lord, we are able through the power and love of God to be accountable to Jesus and each other.

European abounds with perspective renderings of figures and landscapes, while Islamic translates artistic impulse into elaborate geometric patterns and linear designs. Through centuries of practicing this purely abstract art, Muslim artists have perfected it to an incomparable elegance.<br>This book contains 190 examples exhibiting the wide range of Islamic geometrical art: hexagon designs, octagon designs, dodecagon designs, combinations of stars and rosettes (of many variations), combinations of squares and octagons, heptagon designs, and pentagon designs. These fundamental shapes give rise to hundreds of different designs, and merely altering an angle or curving a straight line can create an entirely new pattern. When transferred to metal, wood, stucco, mosaic, and paint, these patterns make up the elaborate ornamentation for which Arabic architecture is noted, and twenty-eight examples of actual applications from Cairo and Damascus are included: sanctuary doors, openwork windows, inlaid marble pavements, and ceilings. <br>The reader may wish to try his own hand at drawing patterns, to which purpose dotted construction lines are given for sections of the plates. Artists and designers will appreciate this book as a valuable source for Islamic art and design, which they may use directly or vary at will, and with the added use of color they will find that striking and beautiful results can often be achieved. <br></p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Wholly Kids: Guiding Kids to a Life In Christ</h2><p><p>Helping leaders and parents understand child development just got a whole lot easier! <b>Wholly Kids</b> is an easy-to-read book full of fun illustrations and details about how kids learn.

Combatants from both sides are brought to life: General Archer Vandegrift, who first assembled an amphibious strike force; Isoroku Yamamoto, the naval general whose innovative strategy was tested; the island-born Allied scout Jacob Vouza, who survived hideous torture to uncover the enemy&#x2019;s plans; and Saburo Sakai, the ace flier who shot down American planes with astonishing ease.<br><br> Propelling the Allies to eventual victory, Guadalcanal was truly the turning point of the war. <i>Challenge for the Pacific&nbsp;</i>is an unparalleled, authoritative account of this great fight that forever&nbsp;changed our world.</p><p><b>Robert Leckie</b>&nbsp;(1920&#x2013;2001) was the author of more than 30 works of military history as well as&nbsp;<i>Marines!</i>, a collection of short stories, and&nbsp;<i>Lord, What a Family!</i>, a memoir.<i>&nbsp;</i>Raised in Rutherford, New Jersey, he started writing professionally at age 16,<i>&nbsp;</i>covering sports for&nbsp;the<i> Bergen Evening Record</i><b>&nbsp;</b>of Hackensack, New Jersey. Leckie enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on the day following the attack on Pearl Harbor, going on to serve as a machine gunner<i>&nbsp;</i>and as an intelligence scout and participating in all 1st Marine Division campaigns except<i>&nbsp;</i>Okinawa.&nbsp;He was awarded five battle stars, the Naval Commendation<i>&nbsp;</i>Medal with Combat V, and the Purple Heart. <i>Helmet for My Pillow</i>&nbsp;was his first book; it received the USMC<i>&nbsp;</i>Combat Correspondents Association Award upon publication.PART ONE: THE CHALLENGE <br><br>CHAPTER ONE <br><br>The admiral was tall, hard, and humorless. His face wasof flint and his will was of adamant. In the United States Navy which he commanded it was sometimes said, "He's so tough he shaves with a blow torch." President Roosevelt was fond of repeating this quip in the admiral's presence, hoping to produce, if there had been no reports of fresh disaster in the past twenty-four hours, that fleeting cold spasm of mirth-like an iceberg tick-which the President, the Prime Minister of England, and the admiral's colleagues on the Anglo-American Combined Chiefs of Staff were able to identify as a smile. If levity was rare in Admiral Ernest King, self-doubts or delusions were nonexistent. He was aware that he was respected rather than beloved by the Navy, and he knew that he was hated by roughly half of the chiefs of the Anglo-American alliance. Mr. Stimson, the U.S. Secretary of War, hated him; so did Winston Churchill and Field-Marshal Sir Alan Brooke and&nbsp;Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham. Nevertheless, Admiral King continued to express the wish that was an athema in the ears of these men, as it was also irritating or at least unwelcome in the ears of General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, and General H. H. Arnold, chief of the Army Air Force. <br><br>Admiral King wanted Japan checked. He wanted this even though he was bound to adhere to the grand strategy approved by Roosevelt and Churchill: concentrate on Hitler first while containing the Japanese. But what was containment? Containing the Japanese during the three months beginning&nbsp;with Pearl Harbor had been as easy as cornering a tornado. The Japanese hadcrippled the U.S. Pacific Fleet and all but driven Britain from the IndianOcean by sinking Prince of Wales and Repulse. Except for scattered American carrier strikes against the Gilberts and Marshalls the vast Pacific from Formosa to Hawaii was in danger of becoming a Japanese lake. Wake had fallen; Guam as well; the Philippines were on their way. Japan's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" had already absorbed the Dutch East Indies withall their vast and precious deposits of oil and minerals, it had supplanted the French in Indochina and evicted the British from Singapore. Burma, Malaya, and Thailand were also Japanese. The unbreachable Malay Barrier had been broken almost as easily as the invincible Maginot Line had been turned. <br>Japan now looked west toward India with her hundreds of millions; and if Rommel should beat the British in North Africa, a German-Japanese juncture in the Middle Eastwould become a dreadful probability. <br><br>Meanwhile, great China was cut off andAustralia-to which General Douglas MacArthur had been ordered should he succeed in escaping from Corregidor-was threatened by a Japanese invasion of New Guinea. At that moment in early March, as Admiral King knew, the necessary invasion force was being gathered at Rabaul, the bastion which the Japanese were building on the eastern tip of New Britain. All this-all this ferocious speed and precision, all this lightning conquest, this sweeping of the seas and seizure of the skies-all this was containment? Admiral King did not think so. He thought it was rather creeping catastrophe. He thought that the Japanese, unchecked, would reach outagain. They would try to cut off Australia, drive deeper eastward toward Hawaii; and build an island barrier behind which they could drain off there sources of their huge new stolen empire. It was because King feared this eventuality that he had, as early as January 1942, when the drum roll of Japanese victories was beating loudest, moved to put a garrison of American troops on Fiji. <br><br>Already forging an island chain to Australia, he was still not satisfied: in mid-February he wrote to General Marshall urging that it wasessential to occupy additional islands "as rapidly as possible." The Chief of Staff did not reply for some time. When he did, he asked what King's purpose might be. The Navy Commander-in-Chief, Cominch as he was called, answered that he hoped to build a series of strong points from which a"step-by-step" advance might be made through the Solomon Islands against Rabaul. That was on March 2. Three days later, Admiral King addressed a memorandum to President Roosevelt. He outlined his plan of operations against the Japanese. He summarized them in three phrases: Hold Hawaii. Support Australasia. Drive northwestward from New Hebrides. Admiral Ernest King was not then aware of it, but he had at that moment put a tentative finger on an island named Guadalcanal. Japan was preparing to reach out again. <br><br>At Imperial General Headquarters in Tokyo the faces of the planners were bright with victory fever. Who could blame them, really? Who else might bask so long in such a sun of success without becoming slightly giddy? Of course, some of the officers of the Naval General Staff had passed from fever into delirium. Some of them-conscious that it was the Navy which had brought off the great stroke at Pearl Harbor, which had played the greater role in the other victories, which had shot the enemy aviators from the skies-some of them were proposing that Australia be invaded. The Navy's cooler heads found the proposal ridiculous. The men of the Army General Staff thought it was impossible. The Army, they explained, could never scrape together the ten divisions or more required for such an operation. The Navy officers nodded reflectively, saying nothing of their underlying suspicion that the Army,&nbsp;optimistic about Germany's chances against Russia that spring, was secretly hoarding its forces for use on the continent. The Army, as they knew, regarded the Soviet Union as the number one potential enemy. &nbsp;Therefore, the Army,looking northwestward, could not be expected to be enthusiastic about committing troops in the southeast. <br><br>So the Naval General Staff decided that instead ofinvading Australia it would be more feasible to isolate Australia. The flow of American war mat�riel to the island continent could be blocked by seizing eastern New Guinea and driving through the Solomons into the New&nbsp;Caledonia-Fijis area. What did the Army think of this? The Army approved. It promised to furnish its South Seas Detachment for the operation. These decisions also were reached in March. On the eighth day of that month, Lae and Salamaua in New Guinea were invaded. Two days later Finschhafen was occupied. Unknowingly, Imperial General Headquarters had pointed its baton at the island called Guadalcanal. Among the forces gathering for the operation to isolate Australia was the Japanese Navy's 25th Air Flotilla. Its mission was to hammer at Port Moresby, the big Allied base on New Guinea which lay only a few hundred miles north of the Australian continent. <br><br>But in early March the 25th Air Flotilla was understrength. One of its three components, and perhaps the best in quality,the Tainan Fighter Wing, was still far away on the fabled island of Bali in the East Indies. Orders were dispatched to Bali alerting the Tainan Wing for movement. Saburo Sakai was the crack pilot of the crack Tainan Fighter Wing. Saburo was not only a born fighter, he was born into a fightingcaste. He was a samurai, the scion of professional soldiers, and he could trace his ancestry to those samurai who had invaded Korea in the sixteenth century. Saburo regarded himself as a samurai even though that caste had been abolished by the great Emperor Meiji at the end of the last century. Saburo was proudthat his ancestors were among those haughty warriors of the city of Saga who had refused to give up their twin swords and had risen in revolt. And if, because of Imperial rescript, the proud and cruel samurai could no longer becruel, no longer swing their heavy two-handed sabers to sever, at a single slash, the body of some poor defenseless Eta or pariah who had offended them, they could always remain proud. <br><br>Saburo Sakai's people had remained proud,scratching out a bare subsistence on a tiny farm near Saga, still scorningmoney, still wearing the emblem of the two sabers symbolic of their caste, andstill priding themselves on their stoic indifference to pain and the strengthof their sword hands. Then, in the 1930s, the military adventurers seized power in Japan. The samurai was again in favor; his knightly code of bushido-a mixture of chivalry and cruelty-was adopted as the standard for all the young men of Japan. <br><br>In 1933, at the age of sixteen, Saburo enlisted in the Navy. Heendured the purposeful torture called "recruit training" in the Japanese Navy, went to sea on the battleships Kirishima and Haruna, applied forthe Navy Flier's School, and was accepted. Saburo, a youth of normal Japanese height, which is about a half foot shorter than that of the normal American, possessed an iron body.Though his nature was warm and good-humored, his will was of the same unbending metal. He became the outstanding student pilot of the year. He could hang by one arm from the top of a pole for half an hour, swim fifty meters in well under thirty seconds, stay underwater for two and a half minutes, and because a fighter pilot's movements need to be quick, he had so conditioned his reflexes that he could catch a fly in a single lightning lunge. At the end of 1937 Saburo was graduated as the outstanding student of the Thirty-eighth Non-Commissioned Officers Class. Of seventy-five handpicked candidates for that class, only twenty-five had survived. One day Japan would rue this policy of training only an elite of an elite, of providing itself with no reserve of skilled pilots to offset combatlosses, but in the Sino-Japanese War of the mid-1930s the Japanese pilots fought with such clear superiority as to indicate that they would have a long combat life indeed. <br><br>Saburo Sakai fought in that war. He became famous for his ardor and daring. Wounded once during a surprise enemy air raid, he ran for his plane streaming blood, taking off to pursue the Chinese bombers and to cripple one of them before he was forced to return to base. By December 7, 1941, Saburo Sakai was already an ace. He flew from Formosa in the first strikes against Clark Field in the Philippines. He was the first Japanese pilot to shoot down an American fighter over those islands. He was the first to flame a Flying Fortress, the very bomber piloted by Captain Colin Kelly, America's first war hero. By March of 1942, Saburo Sakai had shot down thirteen aircraft: Chinese,Russian, British, Dutch, and American. By that time also he and his comrades had reassembled at Bali. They were there to rest, but inactivity only made them restless. They became irritable. They fought with the soldiers who guarded their base. They drank or visited those brothels without which no Japanese&nbsp; military force can long endure. Saburo Sakai did neither, for he was a fighterpilot and a samurai who stuck to his code. Nevertheless, he also fretted,wondering if he would ever get home to see his family. <br><br>On March 12 came the great news. Rotation! The men with the longest time overseas were being relieved to go home, and Saburo had more time out than any of them. But the new leader of the Wing, Lieutenant Commander Tadashi Nakajima, did not call Saburo's name. Crushed, Saburo asked him if there had been a mistake. "No, you do not go home with the other men,"Nakajima said. "I need you, Sakai, to go with me. We are advancing to anew air base. It's Rabaul-on the island of New Britain-the foremost postagainst the enemy. You're the best pilot in the squadron, Sakai, and I want youto fly with me." There was no appeal, not for an enlisted man in theJapanese Navy. Heartbroken, Saburo Sakai became one of eighty pilots who were herded aboard a tiny, stinking, decrepit freighter for the 2500-mile voyage toRabaul. Only a 1000-ton subchaser escorted them. Indifferent to human suffering, and therefore blind to human value, Japan had placed a good portion of her finest naval fliers aboard a rusty old derelict and exposed them to the very real peril of a single torpedo or 500-pound bomb. But the rattler made Rabaul. It entered spacious,horseshoe-shaped Simpson Harbor and discharged its passengers. <br><br>The pilots were appalled. Vunakanau Airfield was little more than a narrow, dusty airstrip setin the shadow of a live volcano. From time to time a deep rumbling shook thefield and smoke and stones spouted from the crater's mouth. Nevertheless the men took heart when a sea plane tender delivered twenty of the latest models ofthe Zero fighter. They went back into action, and Saburo Sakai was again the scourge of the enemy. He flew on fighter sweeps to Port Moresby or escorted twin-engine "Betty" bombers on raiding forays over the big Allied base, and he shot down enemy planes with astonishing ease. The American P-39s and P-40s-Bell Airacobras and Curtiss Warhawks-were no match for the Japanese Zeros. The Zero was faster and much more maneuverable; and no one could cut inside an enemy fighter's turn so sharply as Saburo Sakai, bringing the American or Australian pilot under the full aimed fire of twin 20-mm. cannon and a pair of light machine guns. Saburo's squadron always flew west toward New Guinea. <br><br>But there were other planes of the 25th Air Flotilla which flew southeast to the Solomon Islands. Beginning with big Bougainville about two hundred miles southeast of Rabaul, the Solomons run on a southeast tangent for roughly another four hundred miles. They form a double chain of islands-actually the peaks of a great drowned mountain range-facing each other at near-regular intervals across a straight blue channel from twenty to one hundred miles wide. The objective of the Japanese bombers was the tiny islandof Tulagi, the site of the headquarters of the British Resident Commissioner-for Britain held the Southern Solomons-and now used by the Royal Australian Air Force as a sea plane base. <br><br>There was also a radio station onTulagi. The Japanese bombed it regularly. They could not know that their explosives were merely convulsing the rubble of ancient and inadequate radio equipment. The operator, a retired Australian seaman named Sexton, had continually complained to headquarters: "If the Japs come here and ask me where the radio station is, and I show them this, they'll shoot me for concealing the real one."6 Tulagi had an excellent anchorage, formed between the island's northern shore and the bigger bulk of Florida Island to the north. Sometimes, after the Japanese pilots had watched their bomb-hits making yellow mushrooms on the radio station, or their misses forming white rings in theblack of the bay, they banked lazily to fly low over a large long island twenty miles directly across the channel behind or to the south of Tulagi-Florida.<p>Seen from the sky, it was a beautiful island; about ninety miles in length and twenty-five at its widewaist, and traversed end to end by lofty mountains, some as high as 8000 feet.The mountains crowded steeply down to the sea on Guadalcanal's southern or weather coast, abruptly joining reefs and rocks where a thunderous tall surf pounded eternally: no boats could land on that coast, and very few could hold at anchor there. But the northern coast, ah!, there was a long and gentle shore upon which the smallest boats might beach.</p></p><h2>Rules for Radicals Defeated: A Practical Guide for Defeating Obama/Alinsky Tactics</h2><p>Rules for Radicals is the playbook for the Left.

A thin web of ships in both asteroid belts; a few stations; a corporate settlement on Luna. No one had seen any sign of other space-faring races; everyone expected that First Contact, if it came, would happen in the future, in the empty reaches between the stars. Then a young navigator on a distant mining ship saw something moving too fast, heading directly for our sun.</p><p>When the alien ship screamed through the solar system, it disrupted communications between the far-flung human mining ships and supply stations, and between them and Earth. So Earth and Luna were unaware that they had been invaded until the ship pulled into Earth orbit, and began landing terra-forming crews in China. Politics and pride slowed the response on Earth, and on Luna, corporate power struggles seemed more urgent than distant deaths. But there are a few men and women who see that if Earth doesn't wake up and pull together, the planet could be lost.</p><p>THE ENDER UNIVERSE</p><p> Ender series<br> <i>Ender&#x2019;s Game </i>/ <i>Speaker for the Dead </i>/ <i>Xenocide </i>/ <i>Children of the Mind </i>/<i> Ender in Exile </i>/ <i>Children of the Fleet</i></p><p> Ender&#x2019;s Shadow series<br> <i>Ender&#x2019;s Shadow </i>/ <i>Shadow of the Hegemon </i>/ <i>Shadow Puppets </i>/ <i>Shadow of the Giant </i>/ <i>Shadows in Flight</i></p><p> The First Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)<br> <i>Earth Unaware </i>/ <i>Earth Afire </i>/ <i>Earth Awakens</i></p><p> The Second Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)<br> <i>The Swarm </i>/ <i>The Hive</i></p><p> Ender novellas<br> <i>A War of Gifts </i>/ <i>First Meetings</i></p></p><p><p>ORSON SCOTT CARD is the author of the international bestsellers <i>Shadow of the Giant</i>, <i>Shadow Puppets</i>, <i>Shadow of the Hegemon</i>, and <i>Ender's Shadow</i>, and of the beloved classic of science fiction <i>Ender's Game</i>, as well as the acclaimed fantasy series The Tales of Alvin Maker.

Yet when Bingwen saw that it was within his grasp, he didn&#x2019;t hesitate. He was as respectful of authority as any child could be&#x2014;but he was also keenly aware when he was right, and those in authority were either wrong or uncertain.</p> <p>Uncertainty was what surrounded Bingwen now, in a barracks building of an abandoned military base in southeast China. The men around him were Mobile Operations Police&#x2014;MOPs&#x2014;and Bingwen knew that, as an eight-year-old Chinese boy, he was only with them because Mazer Rackham had adopted him.</p> <p>How long would they allow him to remain with them, now that Mazer Rackham was gone?</p> <p>Gone and probably dead.</p> <p>Bingwen had seen plenty of death since the Formics first began spraying the fields of his homeland with a gas that turned all living tissues, plant and animal, into rotting jelly, breaking down into their constituent organic molecules. Turning back into fertile soil. A vast compost heap, ready for whatever the Formics intended to plant in their place.</p> <p>The Formics killed indiscriminately. They slew harmless people at their labors, terrified people fleeing from them, and soldiers firing at them, all with the same implacable efficiency. Bingwen had seen so much death he was glutted with it. He was no fool. He knew that just because he needed Mazer Rackham to be alive did not mean that the Formics would not kill him.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s why he was so certain that Mazer was alive: The team had succeeded in its mission. The plan was good. And if something had gone wrong, Mazer was the kind of resourceful, quick-thinking soldier who would see a way out and lead his men through it. Whether he was the commander or not.</p> <p>That was what Bingwen had learned from watching Mazer Rackham. Mazer wasn&#x2019;t the leader of the MOPs team. But the MOPs soldiers were trained to think for themselves and to listen to good ideas no matter whether they came from leaders, eight-year-old Chinese orphans who happened to be very, very good with computers, or a half-Maori New Zealander who had been rejected for MOPs training on the first go-round but who persisted until he practically forced his way onto the team.</p> <p>Mazer Rackham was with the MOPs in China only because he was the kind of man who never, never, never gave up.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m going to be that kind of man, too, thought Bingwen.</p> <p>No.</p> <p>I <i>am</i> that kind of man. I&#x2019;m small, young, untrained as a soldier, and as a child I&#x2019;m someone these men expect to protect but never listen to. But they never expected to listen to Mazer Rackham, either, never expected him to be one of them. I&#x2019;m going to find him, and if he needs saving I&#x2019;m going to save him, and then he can go back to taking care of me.</p> <p>Bingwen had been watching the monitor with the rest of them, when the lens on the barracks roof showed the impossibly bright flare of the nuclear explosion, followed by the mushroom cloud. They all knew what it meant. The team consisting of Captain Wit O&#x2019;Toole, Mazer Rackham, and Calinga had succeeded in piloting their Chinese drill sledges <i>under</i> the impenetrable shield that surrounded the lander, and then set off the nuclear device. If they had not reached their objective, they wouldn&#x2019;t have set off the nuke.</p> <p>But did they set it off as planned, with a timer that allowed them time to dive back into the earth on their drill sledges and get clear of the blast zone? Or did they set it off as a suicidal act of desperation, barely managing to do it as the Formics prevented them from getting away?</p> <p>That was the uncertainty that filled the barracks now, six hours after the explosion. Should they wait for O&#x2019;Toole, Calinga, and Rackham to return? Or should they assume they were dead and go forward to try to assess the effectiveness of the attack?</p> <p>Bingwen would be useless on such a reconnaissance mission. His radiation suit had been designed for a small adult, which meant it hung on Bingwen&#x2019;s eight-year-old frame like an oversized sleeping bag. He had scrunched up the arms and legs in order to reach the feet and gloves, but the accordion effect forced him to stand bowlegged and waddle when he walked. When it was time for the MOPs to leave the barracks, Bingwen would be left behind&#x2014;and they would be right to leave him.</p> <p>Meanwhile, though, Bingwen was useful for the only kind of recon that was possible right now&#x2014;by radio and computer. All the MOPs were trained on all their hardware, and were very good at improvising with whatever was at hand. They had antennas on the roof as soon as the explosion was confirmed, as well as a small sat dish. Already they were getting confirmation from their own sources in faraway places that all Formic activity around the nuked lander had ceased.</p> <p>What Bingwen was good for was monitoring the Chinese radio frequencies. As the only native speaker of the southern Chinese dialect and the best speaker of the official Mandarin tongue, Bingwen was the one most likely to make sense of the fragments of language they were picking up.</p> <p>And even as he listened, he was using one of the holodesks they had found at this base to scan the available networks to see what was being said among the various Chinese military groups.</p> <p>Anything official, any orders from central command, would be encoded. Anything not encoded was likely to be of the &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening? Who set off that explosion? Was it nuclear?&#x201d; variety&#x2014;questions to which MOPs already knew the answers.</p> <p>But Bingwen was deft at finding his way into computer networks that didn&#x2019;t want to admit him. The computer he was using was in the office where official communiqu�s would have been received. The computer had been wiped before being abandoned, but it wasn&#x2019;t a real wipe, it was just a superficial erasure. They had left in a hurry and who did they expect to come in after them? Formics&#x2014;and Formics completely ignored human computers and other communications, that was well known. So the computer wipe had been cursory, and it had taken Bingwen only a few minutes to unwipe everything.</p> <p>That meant that while Bingwen couldn&#x2019;t possibly decode anything himself, the decoding software was in place, and after several false starts and reboots he had managed to get in using the password of a junior officer.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the junior officer had been <i>so</i> junior that he was only able to decode fairly routine messages, which meant that Bingwen had to labor under the same restrictions. Routine <i>encoded</i> messages were still a huge step up from panicked queries and radio rumors, so while Bingwen continued to listen to the radio chatter that the MOPs operatives were locating for him, he opened message after message as each emerged from the decoding software.</p> <p>Finally he found something useful. &#x201c;Deen!&#x201d; he called out.</p> <p>Deen, an Englishman, was acting CO in O&#x2019;Toole&#x2019;s absence. Everyone knew Bingwen would not have called out to him for anything less than definitive information. So it wasn&#x2019;t just Deen who came, it was everyone who was not actively engaged in an assignment at the moment.</p> <p>Naturally, the computer message was in Chinese, so nobody could read over Bingwen&#x2019;s shoulder. Still, he ran his fingers along the Pinyin text as he interpreted on the fly. &#x201c;Two soldiers in MOPs uniforms,&#x201d; said Bingwen. &#x201c;Held at General Sima&#x2019;s headquarters.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So the Chinese are taking them seriously,&#x201d; said Lobo. &#x201c;Sima&#x2019;s the big guy.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sima&#x2019;s the guy who had absolutely no interest in cooperating with MOPs,&#x201d; pointed out Cocktail.</p> <p>&#x201c;So they&#x2019;re alive,&#x201d; said Bolshakov, &#x201c;but they&#x2019;ve been taken to the guy who is most likely to resent their presence here.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Two soldiers,&#x201d; said Deen. &#x201c;Not three.&#x201d;</p> <p>They all knew that meant that either one of the team had been a casualty during the operation, or three had made it out alive but only two had been taken by the Chinese.</p> <p>By now the decoder had spat out two more messages, and one of them was a follow-up that contained names. &#x201c;Prisoners identified as O&#x2019;Toole and Rackham,&#x201d; said Bingwen.</p> <p>&#x201c;Have they contacted our people at all?&#x201d; asked Deen. &#x201c;Are there negotiations going on for release?&#x201d;</p> <p>Bingwen scanned the message. &#x201c;No. Sima&#x2019;s people are reporting that they have them, but nothing else. They&#x2019;re not asking what to do with them, and they&#x2019;re not reporting what they plan to do.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sima wouldn&#x2019;t ask anybody, and nobody would have the gall to make suggestions,&#x201d; said Bolshakov. &#x201c;Even at the highest levels of the civilian government, they tread lightly when they&#x2019;re dealing with Sima.&#x201d;</p> <p>Silence for a few moments.</p> <p>&#x201c;Extraction would be a bad idea,&#x201d; said Deen. &#x201c;But all the other ideas I can think of are worse.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Even if we can figure out exactly where Sima&#x2019;s base is, we won&#x2019;t know how to get in,&#x201d; said ZZ. &#x201c;Or out again.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I just love winging it in the middle of foreign military bases,&#x201d; said Lobo.</p> <p>&#x201c;And when we succeed in getting them out,&#x201d; said Deen, &#x201c;we will have alienated one of the most powerful men in the Chinese military, right when we <i>ought</i> to be getting credit for saving millions of Chinese lives.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I have an idea,&#x201d; said Bingwen.</p> <p>He waited for them to dismiss him, to tell him to be quiet, to remind him that he was a child. He expected this because it&#x2019;s what adults always did. But they were MOPs. They listened to anybody who might have useful intelligence or offer alternative plans.</p> <p>Bingwen began to type into a message window. He was writing in Pinyin, because that was his native language, but he translated as he went. &#x201c;MOPs team headed by Captain Wit O&#x2019;Toole gives all honor and thanks to glorious General Sima for providing MOPs with drilling sledges to carry MOPs nuclear device under Formic defenses.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t get the sledges from Sima,&#x201d; said Cocktail.</p> <p>&#x201c;We got them in spite of his opposition, didn&#x2019;t we?&#x201d; said Bolshakov.</p> <p>&#x201c;Let the kid write in peace,&#x201d; said Deen.</p> <p>Bingwen was still typing, interpreting into English as he went. &#x201c;All credit to glorious General Sima of People&#x2019;s Liberation Army for coming up with plan to destroy Formic lander from inside. All thanks to him for allowing MOPs soldiers to have great honor of carrying out his plan using nuclear device General Sima requested. Proud to report complete success of nuclear venture. Surviving MOPs soldiers have returned to General Sima to report complete success of his brilliant and daring plan.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What a pack of crap,&#x201d; said Bungy.</p> <p>&#x201c;Brilliant crap,&#x201d; said Deen. &#x201c;Crap that might get the Captain and Rackham out of jail.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;This little orphan boy is playing international politics better than most grown-ups,&#x201d; said Bolshakov. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ask Sima anything, don&#x2019;t beg, don&#x2019;t extract. Just give him all the credit and announce to everybody that our men are in his headquarters. He&#x2019;s not going to <i>deny</i> any of this. We did this without his consent and it worked, but by giving him credit for it we take away all his embarrassment and give him every incentive to treat our guys like heroes.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I wrote it in Chinese because I know how to make it sound formal and proper,&#x201d; said Bingwen. &#x201c;But now I need somebody with better English to write it so it will sound right in the international version.&#x201d;</p> <p>For the next fifteen minutes, Deen and Bolshakov helped Bingwen make a credible sentence-by-sentence translation into credible English that sounded as if it might be the original from which Bingwen&#x2019;s announcement had been translated. Meanwhile, ZZ and Cocktail came up with a recipient list that included high Chinese government offices, MOPs&#x2019; own headquarters, and news nets around the world. &#x201c;One more thing,&#x201d; said Deen. &#x201c;Sign Captain O&#x2019;Toole&#x2019;s name to it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t like that,&#x201d; said ZZ.</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll love it, if it gets him away from the Chinese,&#x201d; said Deen.</p> <p>A few moments later, Deen reached down into the holodisplay and twisted send.</p> <p>&#x201c;If this doesn&#x2019;t work,&#x201d; said Cocktail, &#x201c;we can still go in and kill a lot of people and drag our guys out like in an action movie.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What Cocktail is saying,&#x201d; ZZ translated to Bingwen, &#x201c;is that if this works, you saved a lot of people&#x2019;s lives and got us out of a jam.&#x201d;</p> <p>What Bingwen was thinking was: Mazer wasn&#x2019;t killed by the nuke or the Formics, and maybe I just saved him from the Chinese.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Orson Scott Card and Aaron Johnston</p></p><h2>Small Arcs of Larger Circles: Framing Through Other Patterns</h2><p>This is a collection of essays, reflections and poems by Nora Bateson, the noted research designer, film-maker, writer and lecturer. She is the daughter of Gregory Bateson and president of the International Bateson Institute (IBI). Building on Gregory Bateson&#39;s famous book Towards an Ecology of Mind and her own film on the subject, Nora Bateson here updates our thinking on systems and ecosystems, applying her own insights and those of her team at IBI to education, organisations, complexity, academia, and the way that society organizes itself. She also introduces the term symmathesy to describe the contextual mutual learning through interaction that takes place in living entities at larger or smaller scales. While she retains her father&#39;s rigorous attention to definition, observation and academic precision, she also moves well beyond that frame of reference to incorporate more embodied ways of knowing and understanding. These are reflected in her essays and poems on food, Christmas, love, honesty, environmentalism and leadership. [Subject: Systems thinking, education, social anthropology, environmentalism, Bateson, symmathesy]</p><p>This book is a rich feast with poetry, short reflections and more extended pieces introducing the terms transcontextuality and symmathesy . It is a corrective to the excessive emphasis on individualism in the West: I carries the suggestion that I am somehow individual, independent, when interdependence is the law...Transcontextuality reminds us that an understanding of living organisms requires more than one context of study if we are to understand their vitality. Perception of the world of things makes them separate, which means that we can assign some form of agency. However, when the larger intertwined contexts are in focus, agency is diffused. This turns out to be a crucial point, as [Nora Bateson] explains in an essay on leadership within the paradox of agency. For her, there is no such thing as an isolated individual and we consequently require a new understanding of leadership based on interdependency, since leadership itself is the product of many contexts. Whatever happens within a system is an expression of the patterns of that entire system, which means there is no blame and everyone is responsible... This seminal book will give you a new relational lens on life. --David Lorimer in Network Review - Journal of the Scientific and Medical Network, No. 122, 2016<br><br>The way we see affects what we do, writes Nora Bateson near the start of this exploratory, far- ranging foray into unauthorized knowledge . In a series of premise-investigations undertaken by way of essays, conference talks, autobiographical story, quotes and poems, ranging through linguistics, biology, semantics, cognitive theory, justice awareness and embrace of paradox, Bateson invites and advocates suppleness of perception, rigor of mind, and depth of feeling. In this book that moves above all by its questions, Bateson embodies that rarity, a truly free thinker also fully engaged with the fates of all. --Jane Hirshfield, Chancellor of The Academy of American Poets<br><br>This is a book for the adventuresome, prepared to travel, relying on their own resources. It is a little book, but it is dense conceptually. The chapters are both independent arcs and parts of the whole, which indeed does circle around. If I were to name an orientation for this circling, it would be something like a desire for a more fluid and dimensional way of doing things such that ethical behavior can more readily be realized in any relationship, including our relation with the biosphere. The book is realized in various forms ranging from essays, to poems, from conference presentations to personal reflections, including an email to a friend. The style of writing varies, not only between chapters, but often within a chapter. One needs to be nimble to follow the shifts, much like travelling through a highly varied landscape with attention ranging from delight at distant views, concerns about safety of river crossings, to investigations of odd scratches on a tree or delight in a frail flower nestled among rocks. --Pille Bunnell in Cybernetics and Human Knowing, Vol. 24, No.1, 2017</p><h2>The Bible, Disability, and the Church: A New Vision of the People of God</h2><p><i>Inspiring and challenging study that rethinks the Bible&#x2019;s teaching on disability</i><br><br>A theologian whose life experience includes growing up alongside a brother with Down syndrome, Amos Yong in this book rereads and reinterprets biblical texts about human disability, arguing that the way we read biblical texts, not the Bible itself, is what causes us to marginalize persons with disabilities.

This provocative book presents a constructive theology that reminds us of the necessity for rigorous engagement with biblical scholarship in all future theological reflection on disability."<br><br><b>Brian Brock</b><br> - University of Aberdeen<br> "This long-overdue biblical theology of disability is clearly the pinnacle of modern Christian attempts to reclaim texts that have often been seen as offensive to people with disabilities. Readable and winsome, it is just the book to open up disability issues for today's church."<br><br><b>David F. Watson</b><br> - United Theological Seminary<br> "Amos Yong is one of the finest theologians working today, and he has produced a very accessible, well-reasoned, and sensitive volume on the ways in which our readings of Scripture come to bear on the lives of people with disabilities in the church. He helps us to perceive `normate' biases in our traditions of interpretation and to read our sacred texts in new and life-giving ways."<br><br><b><i>Theological Book Review</i></b><br> "Yong's constructive biblical theology of disability is indispensable for both disability and theology studies."<br><br><b><i>Christianity Today</i></b><br> "Yong draws upon his theological training, his Pentecostal faith, and his experience as the older brother of Mark, who has Down syndrome, to form an insightful critique of the assumption that disability is inherently negative. . . . Yong's biblical exegesis and the discussion questions at the end of each chapter offer helpful starting points for a necessary conversation within the church."<br><br><b><i>The Living Church</i></b><br> "In this thought-provoking book, Amos Yong invites the reader to journey through the Bible from a disabilities perspective. . . . He directs this book toward a general audience without meaning to exclude professional theologians, and it is a useful resource for both. . . . Provides a refreshing look at the biblical text."<br><br><b><i>Reviews in Religion and Theology</i></b><br> "Yong approaches this issue of disability with both passion and compassion, and his readers and the churches they serve are in his debt. . . . He opens a space to read biblical texts in ways that empower rather than shame or blame the disabled. . . .

So begins an enthralling narrative account of how Benjamin Franklin--seventy years old, without any diplomatic training, and possessed of the most rudimentary French--convinced France, an absolute monarchy, to underwrite America's experiment in democracy. </p><p>When Franklin stepped onto French soil, he well understood he was embarking on the greatest gamble of his career. By virtue of fame, charisma, and ingenuity, Franklin outmaneuvered British spies, French informers, and hostile colleagues; engineered the Franco-American alliance of 1778; and helped to negotiate the peace of 1783. The eight-year French mission stands not only as Franklin's most vital service to his country but as the most revealing of the man.</p><p>In <i>A Great Improvisation</i>, Stacy Schiff draws from new and little-known sources to illuminate the least-explored part of Franklin's life. Here is an unfamiliar, unforgettable chapter of the Revolution, a rousing tale of American infighting, and the treacherous backroom dealings at Versailles that would propel George Washington from near decimation at Valley Forge to victory at Yorktown. From these pages emerges a particularly human and yet fiercely determined Founding Father, as well as a profound sense of how fragile, improvisational, and international was our country's bid for independence.</p></p><p>Benjamin Franklin began the "the most taxing assignment of his life" at the age of 70: to secure the aid of the French monarchy in helping the fledgling United States establish their republic. The job required tremendous skill, finesse, and discretion, and as Stacy Schiff makes clear in this brilliant book, Franklin was the ideal American, perhaps the only one, to take on the task, due in large part to his considerable personal prestige. One of the most famous men in the world when he landed in France in December 1776, his arrival caused a sensation--he was celebrated as a man of genius, a successor to Newton and Galileo, and treated as a great dignitary, even though the nation he represented was less than a year old and there were many doubts as to whether it would see its second birthday. Though he had no formal diplomatic training and spoke only rudimentary French, Franklin managed to engineer the Franco-American alliance of 1778 and the peace treaty of 1783, effectively inventing American foreign policy as he went along, in addition to serving as chief diplomat, banker, and director of American naval affairs.<p> Franklin recognized and accepted the fact that French aid was crucial to American independence, but some Founding Fathers resented him for making America dependent on a foreign power and severely attacked him for securing the very aid that saved the cause. Schiff offers fascinating coverage of this American infighting, along with the complex political intrigue in France, complete with British spies and French double agents, secret negotiations and backroom deals. <i>A Great Improvisation</i> is an entertaining and illuminating portrait of Franklin's seven-year adventure in France that "stands not only as his greatest service to his country but the most revealing of the man." --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p><b>Stacy Schiff</b> is the author of <i>Vera</i> (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov), which won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 2000, and <i>Saint-Exupery</i>, which was a finalist for the 1995 Pulitzer Prize.

Anne Whiston Spirn, author of the award-winning <i>The Granite Garden: Urban Nature and Human Design</i>, argues that the language of landscape exists with its own syntax, grammar, and metaphors, and that we imperil ourselves by failing to learn to read and speak this language. To understand the meanings of landscape, our habitat, is to see the world differently and to enable ourselves to avoid profound aesthetic and environmental mistakes.<br><br>Offering examples that range across thousands of years and five continents, Spirn examines urban, rural, and natural landscapes. She discusses the thought of renowned landscape authors&#x2015;Thomas Jefferson, Frank Lloyd Wright, Frederick Law Olmsted, Lawrence Halprin&#x2015;and of less well known pioneers, including Australian architect Glenn Murcutt and Danish landscape artist C. Th. S�rensen. She discusses instances of great landscape designers using landscape fluently, masterfully, and sometimes cynically. And, in a probing analysis of the many meanings of landscape, Spirn shows how one person&#x2019;s ideal landscape may be another&#x2019;s nightmare, how Utopian landscapes can be dark. There is danger when we lose the connection between a place and our understanding of it, Spirn warns, and she calls for change in the way we shape our environment, based on the notions of nature as a set of ideas and landscape as the expression of action and ideas in place.</p><p>"The language of landscape," writes ecologist Anne Whiston Spirn, "is our native language." She elaborates: humans lived in natural landscapes well before they knew how to build houses; knew how to read the movements of clouds and birds well before they developed grammars and symbols. Anyone with a keen sensibility can recover that language, she suggests: "A person literate in landscape sees significance where an illiterate person notes nothing. Past and future fires, floods, landslides, welcome or warning are visible to those who can read them in tree and slope, boundary and gate." Spirn goes on to discuss human interactions with the landscape, taking as cases in point such matters as the dolmens of prehistoric Europe, environmentally friendly houses in Denmark and Australia, fountains in Paris, and tree-lined city streets in Philadelphia. Along the way she cites scholars, architects, and artists, learning lessons in how to read place and built form from the likes of Christopher Alexander, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Rachel Carson. She closes with an appeal to landscape architects, builders, and designers to study the natural details of place more closely before they set about changing it: "In landscapes ... the key is to establish a framework that provides overall structure--a structure not arbitrary but congruent with the deep context of a place, to define a vocabulary of forms that expresses the natural and cultural processes of the place." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><b>Anne Whiston Spirn</b> is professor of landscape architecture and regional planning and director of the Urban Studies Program at the University of Pennsylvania.

It is the act of casting your sails for adventure.Imagine it: The sun melts in a thousand shades of orange on a long horizon as your tiny craft cuts through swells, undaunted by the gathering challenge, because out in the haze awaits&#x2014;you can see it&#x2014;the dream of your story, the possibility of immortalizing your life experience, of speaking the truth of what you have seen, and heard, and felt.This can be a long voyage, full of tempest, but I know of no other that can net such riches, for when you write a memoir you change your life. When you set down a truth about the past, a new future dawns.Yet, before you begin this process, you need to understand what a memoir really is. We can&#x2019;t set sail on this adventure unless we&#x2019;re in the same boat, so let&#x2019;s get clear: Life stories fall into two big clumps. There&#x2019;s memoir and there&#x2019;s autobiography.What&#x2019;s the difference?Memoir involves the whittling away of a whole lot of stuff that you have lived and a focusing on one slim section, full of power, that demands to be told. This section may be told chronologically, but it does not necessarily have to be, if the story itself would best be served by some different approach. (You&#x2019;ll learn about structure in part 2 of this book.)Autobiography is an overview of your entire life told chronologically from the "I was born" stage to the "and here I am now" stage.For the purposes of this book, I am dealing with the slice-of-life memoir in which you identify one potent period and you explore it through vivid imagery, honest voice, stunning compassion, and a deep awareness of the larger issues at play that guide your story in a subliminal way&#x2014;myth, metaphor, and current issues of the day. In this book we are not working with the autobiography.In the process I will lead you through in this book, I encourage you to work with childhood stories, because they are ripe with material. Certainly you can apply this same process to any other segment of your life. It&#x2019;s simply an approach you are learning. It can be used again and again.That said, I do believe the most successful memoir is written about periods of our life that are further away in the mists of memory.Why?Because you have some distance from the time period you are exploring. You need that depth of perspective to make sense of the events. Distance gives you wisdom, alternative views, and the possibility of compassion, all elements central to emotionally moving and exciting stories about your life.Setting sail on this voyage of writing stories about your life, or stories that I call memoir, puts you squarely in the territory of what people in the publishing industry call narrative nonfiction. And it&#x2019;s good to know a little bit about that body of water.Why do they call it narrative nonfiction?Because in this form of writing you narrate (tell a story) about something that actually happened (nonfiction).Narrative nonfiction has a gazillion other shapes besides memoir and autobiography, and you might hear about them in a conversation or read about them in an article. Here are some of them, with brief definitions:� Literary nonfiction: A name given to writing that narrates a story using many of the devices of literature to make the writing poetic� Creative nonfiction: A term referring to the use of creative writing techniques mixed in with a nonfiction story, often making the result seem like a novel� Essay: A name given to a piece of personal writing in which the voice of the writer is prominent and which makes some kind of big, or subtle, point� Literary journalism: A term used if the written story includes a kind of journalistic reporting about the worldWhatever the mix of writing techniques used, we have to agree on a term we will use here, together, on this journey, and because I teach a variety of techniques for writing your story&#x2014;techniques that incorporate literary devices, creative writing skills, the logic of the essay writer, and the reporting of the journalist&#x2014;and because I insist on teaching a slice-of-life story format, I use the term "memoir."Memoir comes in many sizes and shapes. What I urge you toward in Shimmering Images is a kind of writing that� Drives the reader forward to find out what happens� Sings with the honesty of your individual voice� Reads like a novel in places� Offers reflective wisdom, in your authentic voice, that touches hearts and taps into the larger world out there, offering opportunities of interest for many readersDon&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;ll teach you how to do these things. One step at a time.<br>Chapter 2 - Claiming Your VoiceTo write compelling memoir, you must first believe you have the right to speak, the right to tell your story, to be heard. You have to believe the story you are telling is important, key to your understanding of life and key to others&#x2019;. For some, this is the highest wall to climb in writing stories about your lives, because too often you have been told that what you think, feel, and have experienced doesn&#x2019;t matter. You may spend a good part of the first few chapters of Shimmering Images battling&#x2014;both inside yourself and in discussions with family and friends. It may come up again and again, stopping you as you progress. That&#x2019;s okay. I expect it. You should expect it, too.I can imagine you right now, holding this book and thinking: Who am I to tell my story? Who cares? Who will listen?Right?Yep, that&#x2019;s part of the process. We deal with it and move on.In my classes and workshops this is always the first order of business. Expect insidious doubt to rear its head as you scratch away the layers of convention that keep you from telling the truth of your life. Expect it to keep coming back. Greet it. And then get on with the next chapter. That&#x2019;s what you must do, because of course your life does matter, and the stories you write about your life are some of the most important work you can do in the world, because once you have written those stories, you will have changed your life.So, expect that nasty little naysayer to show up. Refuse to let it silence the storyteller in you. Push forward. Keep reading these chapters. You will get a story written by the end of this book.First you must claim your life. You must believe in every fiber of your being that you have the right to your reality: the way you interpret how things happened, the way you remember them. It doesn&#x2019;t matter in the world of this book, in the world of art and creativity, in the world we are creating right here, how other members of your family remember the year you were twelve, or how an old lover says that day on the lake unfolded, or how friends report that last evening at the dinner table.In another place and time, those interpretations might be of importance (and maybe you will even work some of those conflicting views into your final written story). But right here and right now, what is central is that you know your truth&#x2014;the version that resonates in your bones, electrifies the very skin of your being&#x2014;is the one truth that will make your writing soar, that will grab readers by the throat and keep them coming back again and again to hear your voice tell them how it was.<br>Chapter 3 - Truth Versus FactLet&#x2019;s talk about</p></p><h2>What to Do When Bad Habits Take Hold: A Kid&#39;s Guide to Overcoming Nail Biting and More (What to Do Guides for Kids)</h2><p>An Honors NAPPA (National Parenting Publications Awards) winner<br><br><i>Nail biting.

Wearing a stolen fur coat and recently fired from her office job, she takes an all-night train to Berlin to make it in the movies. But what she encounters in the city is not fame and fortune, but gnawing hunger, seedy bars, and exploitative men - and as Doris sinks ever lower, she resorts to desperate measures to survive. Very funny and intensely moving, this is a dazzling portrait of roaring Berlin in the 1920s, and a poignant exploration of the doomed pursuit of fame and glamour.</p><p><i>The Artificial Silk Gir</i>l was a huge bestseller in Weimar Germany before the Nazis banned it, and is today Keun's best-loved book in Germany. Funny, fresh and radical in its dissection of the limited options available to working women, it is a novel that speaks to our times.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America&#39;s Underground Food Movements</h2><p><p>An instant classic for a new generation of monkey-wrenching food activists. Food in America is cheap and abundant, yet the vast majority of it is diminished in terms of flavor and nutrition, anonymous and mysterious after being shipped thousands of miles and passing through inscrutable supply chains, and controlled by multinational corporations. In our system of globalized food commodities, convenience replaces quality and a connection to the source of our food. Most of us know almost nothing about how our food is grown or produced, where it comes from, and what health value it really has. It is food as pure corporate commodity. We all deserve much better than that. <br> <br> In <em>The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved</em>, author Sandor Ellix Katz (<em>Wild Fermentation</em>, Chelsea Green 2003) profiles grassroots activists who are taking on Big Food, creating meaningful alternatives, and challenging the way many Americans think about food. From community-supported local farmers, community gardeners, and seed saving activists, to underground distribution networks of contraband foods and food resources rescued from the waste stream, this book shows how ordinary people can resist the dominant system, revive community-based food production, and take direct responsibility for their own health and nutrition.</p></p><p>"The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved is a deeply nutritious book. It is a must for anyone who has sensed that the food world is not only tied to politics and big business, but is also larger and more complex than most of us have been led to believe." --Deborah Madison, author of Local Flavors: Cooking and Eating from America's Farmers' Markets <p>"Sandor Katz provides an in-depth look at the new food revolution and aptly describes a political climate in which "eating well has become an act of civil disobedience." From bread clubs to the raw milk underground, consumers are voting against commercial food with their taste buds and their pocket books. Don't miss this remarkable manifesto." --Sally Fallon, president of the Weston A. Price Foundation and author of Nourishing Traditions </p><p>"Sandor Katz has given us a refreshing, wholesome, wise book on something that affects all our lives. It points us not only to eating in a new way, but thinking in a new way. I hope it will be widely read." --Howard Zinn, author of A People's History of the United States </p><p>"Most importantly, in teaching us about these movements, Katz inspires us to take it a step further, whatever our food persuasions may be. You may end up setting up an underground food market, where people can sell bread that they bake in their own ovens and milk that isn't tampered with by government regulations. You'll gather dandelion leaves, chickweed, mushrooms, prickly pear or whatever else grows in your own backyard. You'll school yourself in herbal healing, live in raw food decadence, get involved in a grassroots land-rights movement or finally take more than five minutes to savor a meal with friends." - Sopaipilla, Earth First! Samhain/Yule 2006</p><p>Sandor Ellix Katz is a fermentation revivalist. A self-taught experimentalist&nbsp;who lives in rural Tennessee, his explorations in fermentation developed out of overlapping interests in cooking, nutrition, and gardening. This book, originally published in 2003, along with his&nbsp;<em>The Art of Fermentation</em> (2012) and the hundreds of fermentation workshops he has taught around the world, have helped to catalyze a broad revival of the fermentation arts. <em>Newsweek</em> called <em>Wild Fermentation</em> "the fermenting Bible," and <em>The New York Times</em> calls Sandor &#x201c;one of the unlikely rock stars of the American food scene.&#x201d;&nbsp;For more information, check out his website&nbsp;www.wildfermentation.com.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Treasures, A Reading/Language Arts Program, Grade 1, Book 2 Student Edition (ELEMENTARY READING TREASURES)</h2><p>Engaging Student Books Reinforce Phonics and Word Instruction.</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Imagining Religion: From Babylon to Jonestown (Chicago Studies in the History of Judaism)</h2><p><p>With this influential book of essays, Jonathan Z. Smith has pointed the academic study of religion in a new theoretical direction, one neither theological nor willfully ideological.<br> <br> Making use of examples as apparently diverse and exotic as the Maori cults in nineteenth-century New Zealand and the events of Jonestown, Smith shows that religion must be construed as conventional, anthropological, historical, and as an exercise of imagination. In his analyses, religion emerges as the product of historically and geographically situated human ingenuity, cognition, and curiosity&#x2014;simply put, as the result of human labor, one of the decisive but wholly ordinary ways human beings create the worlds in which they live and make sense of them.<br> <br> "These seven essays . . . display the critical intelligence, creativity, and sheer common sense that make Smith one of the most methodologically sophisticated and suggestive historians of religion writing today. . . . Smith scrutinizes the fundamental problems of taxonomy and comparison in religious studies, suggestively redescribes such basic categories as canon and ritual, and shows how frequently studied myths may more likely reflect situational incongruities than vaunted mimetic congruities. His final essay, on Jonestown, demonstrates the interpretive power of the historian of religion to render intelligible that in our own day which seems most bizarre."&#x2014;Richard S. Sarason, <i>Religious Studies Review<br> <br></i></p></p><p><b>Jonathan Z. Smith</b> (1938-2017) was Robert O.

Or that the noblest purple comes from a predatory sea snail? In the Roman Empire, hundreds of thousands of snails had to be sacrificed to produce a single ounce of dye. Throughout history, pigments have been made from deadly metals, poisonous minerals, urine, cow dung, and even crushed insects. From grinding down beetles and burning animal bones to alchemy and pure luck, <em>Chromatopia</em> reveals the origin stories behind over fifty of history&#x2019;s most vivid color pigments.</p><p>Featuring informative and detailed color histories, a section on working with monochromatic color, and &#x201c;recipes&#x201d; for paint-making, <em>Chromatopia</em> provides color enthusiasts with an eclectic story of how synthetic colors came to be. Red lead, for example, was invented by the ancient Greeks by roasting white lead, and it became the dominant red in medieval painting.</p><p>Spanning from the ancient world to modern leaps in technology, and vibrantly illustrated throughout, this book will add a little chroma to anyone&#x2019;s understanding of the history of colors.</p> Illustrated in color throughout</p><p>David Coles is the founder and head paint-maker of Langridge Artist Colours, one of the world&#x2019;s most respected makers of artists&#x2019; oil paints.

P. Thompson and Herbert Gutman, David Roediger&#x2019;s widely acclaimed book provides an original study of the formative years of working-class racism in the United States. This, he argues, cannot be explained simply with reference to economic advantage; rather, white working-class racism is underpinned by a complex series of psychological and ideological mechanisms that reinforce racial stereotypes, and thus help to forge the identities of white workers in opposition to Blacks.<br><br>In an afterword to this new edition, Roediger discusses recent studies of whiteness and the changing face of labor itself. He surveys criticism of his work, accepting many objections whilst challenging others, especially the view that the study of working class racism implies a rejection of Marxism and radical politics.</p><p><b>David Roediger</b> is Kendrick Babcock Chair of History at the University of Illinois.

And one of his finest works--the product of his broad interests and expertise--has been <em>A History of the Ancient</em> <em>World</em>, long a standard work on the distant past. Now this landmark book is available in a new edition, offering a informative account of early history from the rise of the first cities to the fall of the Roman Empire.<br> This richly illustrated new edition deftly explores the broad expanse of early human history. Though Greece and Rome occupy center stage, Starr also surveys the cities and empires of Mesopotamia, India from the early Indus civilization to the Gupta state, and China from the Hsia dynasty to the Han empire. In this new edition, he has incorporated the latest research into his lucid and informative narrative, reworking virtually every chapter to bring the work completely up-to-date. He has revised his discussions of early humankind to account for the most recent findings; he presents a new view of the Jewish revolt against Rome led by Bar Kochba; and he has thoroughly updated the bibliographies. In addition, his account of the end of the Roman Empire has been rewritten in light of the most recent thinking by classical historians. Numerous maps and illustrations, carefully composed and selected, highlight the text. And throughout, Starr clearly expresses the complexities of ancient history in lively, engaging prose, making the finest scholarship accessible to the nonspecialist.<br> When <em>A History of the Ancient World</em> appeared in earlier editions, <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em> hailed it as "an excellent one-volume history" and "fascinating reading." And <em>The Classical Journal</em> wrote, "In scope, accuracy, and soundness of judgment this is one of the best general ancient histories." This completely updated Fourth Edition will continue to provide one of the most distinguished and comprehensive one-volume introductions to the ancient past available today.</p><p><br><strong>Chester G.

The authors' main concern is to give their readers command of the major techniques used to control the complexity of large software systems: building abstractions, establishing conventional interfaces, and establishing new descriptive languages.<br> <br> <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> covers a wide range of material, from simple numerical programs, through symbol manipulation, logic programming, interpretation, and compilation. Main sections of the book are: Building Abstractions with Procedures; Building Abstractions with Data; Modularity, Objects, and State, Meta-Linguistic Abstraction; and Computing with Register Machines. Each chapter includes numerous exercises and programming projects. As a programming language, the book uses Scheme, a modern dialect of LISP, which incorporates block structure and lexical scoping.<br> <br> This book inaugurates the MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science series, copublished with McGraw Hill.</p><p>Hal Abelson is Class of 1922 Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a fellow of the IEEE.

Additionally, he serves as co-chair for the MIT Council on Educational Technology."A truly modern introductory text which allows students to discuss the major interesting questions of today. It is a tribute to Professors Abelson and Sussman that they were willing to spend their valued research time to produce such a magnificent text. Controlling complexity, the major theme of the book, is a major concern of programming language designers and software engineers. Imperative, applicative, object-oriented, and logic-based are four trends of programming languages. Scheme allows examples of each.... This book is a rare achievement."<br> &#x2014;<b>Daniel P. Friedman</b>, Indiana University</p><h2>Nazi Literature in the Americas (New Directions Book)</h2><p><p><strong>A "biographical dictionary" gathering 30 brief accounts of poets, novelists and editors (all fictional) who espouse fascist or extremely right-wing political views.</strong></p><em>Nazi Literature in the Americas</em> was the first of Roberto Bolano's books to reach a wide public. When it was published by Seix Barral in 1996, critics in Spain were quick to recognize the arrival of an important new talent. The book presents itself as a biographical dictionary of American writers who flirted with or espoused extreme right-wing ideologies in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is a tour de force of black humor and imaginary erudition.<br><br><em>Nazi Literature in the Americas</em> is composed of short biographies, including descriptions of the writers' works, plus an epilogue ("for Monsters"), which includes even briefer biographies of persons mentioned in passing. All of the writers are imaginary, although they are all carefully and credibly situated in real literary worlds. Ernesto P�rez Mas�n, for example, in the sample included here, is an imaginary member of the real Or�genes group in Cuba, and his farcical clashes with Jos� Lezama Lima recall stories about the spats between Lezama Lima and Virgilio Pinera, as recounted in Guillermo Cabrera Infante's Mea Cuba. The origins of the imaginary writers are diverse. Authors from twelve different countries are included. The countries with the most representatives are Argentina (8) and the USA (7).</p><p>Amazon Significant Seven, February 2008: As with the emergence of W.G. Sebald into English a decade ago, the most exciting new writer to watch is one we're just catching up with: the late Roberto Bola�o, whose ground-breaking fiction defined a generation of Spanish-speaking literature. In between last year's thrillingly meandering epic, <i>The Savage Detectives</i>, and the upcoming alleged masterwork, <i>2666</i>, comes a small and strange book (but no stranger than the rest), <i>Nazi Literature in the Americas</i>. Presented as a biographical encyclopedia of right-wing writers in North and South America, these short, invented lives are full of the stuff of minor literary scenes and forgotten books, with delusion and creation mixed in equal fashion. Funny, melancholy, surprisingly tender, and--once in a while--erupting into fury, Bola�o spins out tale after tale with the joy of sheer invention and the burden of inescapable history. <i>--Tom Nissley</i>Artfully develops into a satire about monstrous politics and failed ambition.</p><h2>Color Atlas of Anatomy: A Photographic Study of the Human Body (Color Atlas of Anatomy (Rohen))</h2><p><p>This atlas features outstanding full-color photographs of actual cadaver dissections, with accompanying schematic drawings and diagnostic images. The photographs depict anatomic structures more realistically than illustrations in traditional atlases and show students exactly what they will see in the dissection lab.</p> <p>Chapters are organized by region in order of a typical dissection. Each chapter presents structures both in a systemic manner from deep to surface, and in a regional manner.</p> <p>This edition has sixteen additional pages of clinical images&#x2014;including CT and MRI&#x2014;that students can compare with cross-sectional anatomic photographs.

The book's unique approach - teaching the elements of poetry through various poetic forms - encourages students to learn from existing models and to break free from pre-established constraints. In thirteen chapters centered on the sonnet, the haiku, and other traditional and not-so-traditional forms, the author demonstrates through numerous innovative exercises the many ways in which beginning poets can enrich their writing by studying and practicing poetic form.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></p><p></p><h2>The Hen Who Dreamed She Could Fly: A Novel</h2><p><b><b>The Korean <i>Charlotte's Web<br><br></i>More than 2 million copies sold</b><br> &nbsp;</b><br> This is the story of a hen named Sprout. No longer content to lay eggs on command, only to have them carted off to the market, she glimpses her future every morning through the barn doors, where the other animals roam free, and comes up with a plan to escape into the wild&#x2014;and to hatch an egg of her own.<br><br> An anthem for freedom, individuality and motherhood featuring a plucky, spirited heroine who rebels against the tradition-bound world of the barnyard, <i>The Hen Who Dreamed She Could Fly </i>is a novel of universal resonance that also opens a window on Korea, where it has captivated millions of readers. And with its array of animal characters&#x2014;the hen, the duck, the rooster, the dog, the weasel&#x2014;it calls to mind such classics in English as <i>Animal Farm </i>and <i>Charlotte&#x2019;s Web.</i><br><br> Featuring specially-commissioned illustrations, this first English-language edition of Sun-mi Hwang&#x2019;s fable for our times beautifully captures the journey of an unforgettable character in world literature.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, November 2013:</strong> You could read the adventures and struggles of Sprout, an egg-laying hen who escapes the coop with dreams of hatching her own chick, as a straightforward children&#x2019;s book. But just like all enduring classics, peel back a few layers and <em>The Hen Who Dreamed She Could Fly</em> easily transcends the just-for-kids label by deftly tackling universal themes of individuality, nurturing the young, the cycle of life and death, the meaning of friendship, and the eternal parent-child bond. This English-language translation of the best-selling Korean novel is sparse and economical as befitting the fable-like tale, allowing phrases and moments to breathe with emotion. You&#x2019;ll root for Sprout as she pluckily faces the elite barnyard coterie for a place to rest her head or as she tirelessly guards her baby from a hungry, conniving weasel. Anyone who is a parent--or has ever been loved by one--will find a moment (or two) where it&#x2019;s hard to keep the tears at bay. --<em>Bora McAteer</em><b>Sun-mi Hwang</b> is a beloved writer in South Korea, where she has won many awards and published more than forty books enjoyed by adults and children alike.

Schindler</p><p>Chapter OnePesah<br>Feasting for Freedom<p>Passover (Pesah), which celebrates the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, begins on the fifteenth of the month of Nisan and continues for seven days, through Nisan 21, though many Diaspora communities celebrate it for eight days (see discussion of the second day of festivals in Appendixes 1. and 2). The name Passover is taken from the Exodus story: During the tenth and ultimate plague inflicted on Pharaoh to break his will, God passed over the Israelites and struck down only the Egyptian firstborn. That night Pharaoh finally agreed to let the Israelites go; and ever since then, we gather together on that night to commemorate that time, and to contemplate the meaning of being freed by the "mighty hand and outstretched arm" of the Holy One.</p><p>The central meaning of Passover is liberation, and hence it is also called <i>zeman heiruteinu</i> -- the season of our liberation. Another name for Passover is <i>hag ha-aviv</i> -- the holiday of spring. The Jewish calendar is set so that certain holidays always occur in a particular season of the year (unlike, for instance, the Moslem calendar). Thus, the holiday of liberation is also the holiday of spring, not simply by coincidence but by design. Following the bleakness of winter when everything is covered with the shrouds of snow, spring marks the rebirth of the earth with the bursting forth of green life. Similarly, a people enshackled in oppressive slavery, doomed to a slow process of degradation or even extinction, bursts forth out of Egypt into a new life's journey leading to a land flowing with milk and honey. The watchwords of both spring and Pesah are <i>rebirth</i> and <i>hope</i>. Thus, the spirit of renewed optimism aroused by the sights and smells of spring are reinforced in a Jewish context by Passover with its trumpeting of the possibilities of liberation. Passover reminds us annually that no matter how terrible our situation, we must not lose hope. Passover holds out the possibility of renewal, proclaiming that such change is as intrinsic to human nature as are blossoming trees to the natural world.</p><p>Another name for Pesah is <i>hag ha-matzot</i> -- the holiday of the unleavened bread. The matzah evokes images of that night when the Israelites ate the sacrificial lamb in fearful and eager anticipation of the future. Around them arose the wails of Egyptians mourning the deaths of their firstborn. Suddenly, the word came from Moses to hurry forth. The Israelites had no time to let the dough rise for bread, and so they carried with them this "matzah" as their only provisions.</p><p>Matzah as a symbol of liberation is meant to trigger in our minds the whole story, which began in slavery and ended in freedom. It also reminds us of God's role in the Exodus, for it recalls the simple faith of the Israelites, who were willing to leave the home they knew and go off into the desert. Having seen God's redemptive power, they trusted in His promise. As His people, they were willing to follow after Him into "an unsown land" (Jer. 2:2).</p><p>It is this act of redemption by God that establishes the Covenant between Israel and God. Prior to the Exodus, the covenantal relationship existed only between God and individuals-for example, between God and Abraham. Passover marks the beginning of the relationship between God and the Jews as a people. God's claim to the Covenant lies in His having fulfilled His promise to bring us out of Egypt. Having redeemed us, God promises: "And I will take you to be My people, and I will be your God. And you shall know that 1, the Lord, am your God who freed you from the burdens of the Egyptians" (Exod. 6:7).</p><p>This covenantal relationship lies at the heart of the celebration of Passover. We rejoice for the past liberation from Egypt and for other redemptions by God since then. And because of the fulfillment of past promises, we anticipate at Passover the future final redemption. We create a special role for the prophet Elijah at the seder (see below) as the symbol of our faith in the redemption soon to come.</p><p>Because it is the crucial event that marks the beginning of our sacred history, the Exodus is referred to repeatedly in Jewish liturgy and thought. For example, the shema (the central prayer in Jewish liturgy) concludes "I, the Lord, am your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I the Lord your God" (Num. 15:41). At Passover we are commanded to tell the story of the Exodus. This commandment, unique to this holiday, leads us not simply to remember the Exodus but to expand upon the tale, to explore its complexities and develop its meaning. Thus the Haggadah, the liturgy we use at the seder, states:</p><p>In every generation, each person should feel as though she or he were redeemed from Egypt, as it is said: "You shall tell your children on that day saying, 'It is because of what the Lord did for me when I went free out of Egypt.' For the Holy One redeemed not only our ancestors; He redeemed us with them."</p><p>The uniqueness of Passover is encapsulated in the above passage. It teaches us that Jewish history is also a timeless present, that Passover is not simply a commemoration of an important event in our past-analogous to the Fourth of July or Bastille Day-but an event in which we participated and in which we continue to participate. We are meant to reexperience the slavery and the redemption that occurs in each day of our lives. It is our own story, not just some ancient history that we retell at Passover.</p><p>To relive the experience, we are commanded to observe three rituals:</p><p>1. To tell the story of the Exodus. As the Torah states: "Remember this day, on which you went free from Egypt, the house of bondage, how the Lord freed you from it with a...</p>&#34;Help[s] readers understand more fully the meaning of our holidays and thereby to observe these festivals...with a greater devotion and joy.&#34;-- Rabbi Alexander M.

Dostoyevsky spent nearly two years writing The Brothers Karamazov, which was published as a serial in The Russian Messenger and completed in November 1880. The author died less than four months after its publication. The Brothers Karamazov is a passionate philosophical novel set in 19th century Russia, that enters deeply into the ethical debates of God, free will, and morality. It is a spiritual drama of moral struggles concerning faith, doubt, and reason, set against a modernizing Russia, with a plot which revolves around the subject of patricide. Dostoyevsky composed much of the novel in Staraya Russa, which inspired the main setting. Since its publication, it has been acclaimed as one of the supreme achievements in world literature.</p></p><p><p> <strong>FyodorDostoyevsky </strong>(18211881), one of nineteenth-century Russias greatest novelists, spent four years in a convict prison in Siberia, after which he was obliged to enlist in the army. In later years his penchant for gambling sent him deeply into debt. Most of his important works were written after 1864, including <strong>Notes from Underground</strong>, <strong>Crime and Punishment</strong>, <strong>The Idiot</strong>, and <strong>The Brothers Karamazov,</strong> all available from Penguin Classics.</p></p><h2>A Royal Duty</h2><p>A former butler for Princess Diana who became her trusted confidant recalls his ten years of service to the princess, separating the truth from the myths of her life to offer his insights into her years as a member of the royal family.</p><p>Paul Burrell served the Royal Family for twenty-one years - as personal footman to the Queen, butler to the Prince and Princess of Wales and, after their separation, butler to Diana.

He contributed to Yiddish newspapers in Warsaw and Kiev, where his short story, ''Pearls,'' was published, which brought him immediate recognition. In 1921 he was hired as a correspondent for the <i>Jewish Daily Forward</i>. In 1927 he wrote his first novel, <i>Steel and Iron</i>, which was followed five years later by <i>Yoshe Kalb</i>. He came to the United States in 1934, and within two years <i>The Brothers Ashkenzai</i> was published, a work that was not only an instant success but was also destined to become a classic in its time.The children loved the yard, no one more so than Jacob Bunem.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Sima Meir,&#x201d; he would cry in a loud voice that expressed his lust for life, &#x201c;come play tag.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to,&#x201d; Simha Meir would say brusquely and turn away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twins didn&#x2019;t get along.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob Bunem would have preferred it otherwise. He was bigger, stronger, full of laughter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Jacob Bunem, why do you always laugh?&#x201d; others asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Cause I feel like it,&#x201d; he would say, and laugh again so that the others felt compelled to join in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his whole heart and soul into the childish games. No one could run faster, or find better hiding places in the foundation when they played hide and seek, or catch the ends of the cord the roper dragged through the courtyard. He could excavate the biggest rocks and raise them overhead. He never grew tired of the games. Not only did he enjoy playing, but he wanted everyone, especially his brother, to do the same. But Simha Meir would have none of it.</p><h2>The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church</h2><p>The third edition of this unrivaled book focuses on the important changes in academic opinion and church organization within the past few years. Extensively revised and updated, it contains increased coverage on Eastern churches, issues in moral theology, and developments stemming from the Second Vatican Council. New entries have been added on a diverse array of subjects including the ordination of women, the quest of the historical Jesus, and bibliographies.</p><p><br><strong>E. A. Livingstone</strong> was involved in the first edition and assumed the editorship of the second on the death of F.L. Cross. She has been responsible for the organization of the International Conferences on Patristic Studies from 1971 to 1995 and has edited the proceedings. The late <strong>F.L. Cross</strong> was the Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford from 1944 to 1968.<br>It will come as no surprise to those already familiar with earlier editions (1957, 1974) that the third edition of this title remains unrivaled as the authoritative one-volume dictionary of the Christian church, its doctrines and practices, and its most influential historical figures. In addition, the reader will find a host of entries pertaining to the Bible and its world. Because of the rise of theologies of liberation since the publication of the second edition, and because of a growing awareness of the need to heed Christian cultures often regarded as on the fringes of Christendom, many doctrinal articles have undergone revision and many have been added. Prominent Evangelicals have also been included (though, owing to this work's decidedly historical thrust, only rarely does the name of a living figure appear). Since the first edition, the need to involve a growing number of experts working in collaboration has been acknowledged, and those named in the editor's preface and in the list of contributors now exceeds 480. The bibliographies for many entries have been updated since the second edition. For future editions, the editors might consider using a standard Bible translation other than the Authorized Version, whose usage has declined sharply in recent decades. From a researcher's standpoint, one might also hope to see the names of contributors under each entry. Nevertheless, this is highly recommended for general libraries, especially those that serve the needs of informed lay readers or ecclesiastical researchers.?Robert H. O'Connell, Denver, Col.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Analysis Patterns: Reusable Object Models</h2><p>Martin Fowler is a consultant specializing in object-oriented analysis and design. This book presents and discusses a number of object models derived from various problem domains. All patterns and models presented have been derived from the author&#39;s own consulting work and are based on real business cases.</p><p>Patterns are higher-order designs that can be reused across projects and types of computer systems. <i>Analysis Patterns: Reusable Object Models</i> defines over 70 patterns, beginning with some from the business world, such as the Party and Accountability patterns, which define the players in organizations and whom they report to. Many of the other patterns are drawn from the health care industry and mainly show patterns of doctor-patient interactions.<p> The patterns for financial markets will probably be accessible for the majority of readers. Author Martin Fowler defines a Transaction pattern (and related patterns) as well as several patterns for the Accounting of Objects. He moves on to modeling stock markets with Portfolio, Quote, and Scenario patterns, which define how a price for a stock is determined for a given moment. Interestingly, he establishes patterns for Forward Contracts (for derivatives) as well as Options, and so takes on a complicated area in today's financial markets.</p><p> Fowler's considerable design experience in these fields is beneficial, as he is able to define each pattern in both text and software engineering diagrams. Only rarely does the author provide implementations of these designs and those that are furnished are done in Smalltalk, which makes this book more suitable for those who have experience in object design.</p>Not long ago, no books were available on object-oriented analysis and design. Now there are so many that it is impossible for any practitioner to keep up with them all. Most of these books concentrate on teaching a notation, suggesting a simple process for modeling, and illustrating it with a few simple examples. Analysis Patterns: Reusable Object Models is a different kind of book. Instead of focusing on the process - how to do modeling - it concentrates on the result of the process - the models themselves.<p>I am a consultant in object modeling for information systems. Clients ask me to train staff on modeling and to provide mentoring on projects. Much of my skill comes from a knowledge of modeling techniques and how to use them. More important, however, is my experience in actually creating many models and regularly seeing problems repeat themselves. Frequently I find that many aspects of a project revisit problems I have faced before. That experience allows me to reuse models I have built before, improve them, and adapt them to new demands.</p><p>Over the last few years, more and more people have also become aware of this phenomenon. We have realized that the typical methodology books, though valuable, only present the first step in a learning process that must also capture the actual things that are built. This realization has flowered into the patterns movement. This is a varied group of people, representing many different interests and opinions yet sharing the goal of propagating useful patterns of software systems.</p><p>As a result of the diversity of this patterns community, we have had difficulty in defining the term pattern. We all think we can recognize a pattern when we see it, we think most of us would agree in most cases, but we cannot come up with a single definition. Here is my definition: A pattern is an idea that has been useful in one practical context and will probably be useful in others. </p><p>I like to leave the definition quite loose because I wish to stay as close to the underlying motivation of patterns, without adding too many restrictive amendments. A pattern can have many forms, and each form adds specializations that are useful for that kind of pattern. (Section 1.2 discusses the current state of the patterns world and where this book fits in.)This book is about patterns in analysis, patterns that reflect conceptual structures of business processes rather than actual software implementations. Most of the chapters discuss patterns for various business domains. Such patterns are hard to classify into traditional vertical areas (manufacturing, finance, health care, and so on) because they are often useful in several areas. These patterns are important because they help us to understand how people perceive the world. It is valuable to base a computer system's design on this perception and, indeed, to change that perception - which is where business process reengineering (BPR) comes in.</p><p>Conceptual patterns cannot exist in isolation, however. Conceptual models are only useful to software engineers if they can see how to implement them. In this book I present patterns that can be used to turn conceptual models into software, and I discuss how that software fits into an architecture for a large information system. I also discuss specific implementation tips with the patterns.</p><p>I wrote this book because this was the book that I wanted to read when I started out. Modelers will find ideas in this book to help them begin working in a new domain. The patterns contain useful models, the reasoning behind their designs, and when they should and should not be applied. With this information a modeler can adapt the models to fit a specific problem. The patterns in this book can also be used in reviewing models - to see what might have been left out and to suggest some alternatives that may lead to improvement. When I review a project, I usually compare what I see with the patterns I have learned from previous work. I have found that being aware of patterns in my work helps me to apply my past experiences more easily. Patterns like this also uncover modeling issues that go beyond what can be covered in a simple text book. By discussing why we model things the way we do, we gain a greater understanding of how to improve our modeling, even if we don't use the patterns directly.</p><p>Structure of this Book This book is divided into two sections. The first section covers analysis patterns, which are patterns from conceptual business models. They provide key abstractions from domains such as trading, measurement, accounting, and organizational relationships. The patterns are conceptual because they represent the way people think about the business, rather than the way a computer system is designed. The chapters in this section stress alternative patterns that can be used, and the strengths and weaknesses of those alternatives. Although each pattern will clearly be useful to those working in the same domain, the basic pattern is often useful in other domains. </p><p>The second section focuses on support patterns, which help you use analysis patterns. Support patterns show how analysis patterns fit into an information systems architecture, how the constructs of conceptual models turn into software interfaces and implementations, and how certain advanced modeling constructs relate to simpler structures.To describe these patterns, I need a notation. The appendix provides a brief discussion of the notation I use and what the symbols mean. I do not use a single method but prefer to mix techniques from different methods. The appendix is not designed to be a tutorial on techniques, but it should provide an outline and refresh your memory. It also tells you where to find a tutorial on the techniques I use.</p><p>Each section is divided into chapters. Each chapter on analysis patterns contains patterns that are related by a loose notion of subject area, influenced by the projects that spawned them. This organization reflects the fact that any pattern must come from a practical context. Each pattern appears in its own subsection within a chapter. I do not use any of the formal headings for patterns that are used by some patterns authors (see Section 1.2.2). I describe each pattern in a form that is as close to the original project form as is reasonable, with a minimum of abstraction. I add examples to show the use of the pattern within its original domain and also to suggest how the pattern might be used in other domains. One of the greatest difficulties of patterns is abstracting them into other domains; I follow the principle that this should be left to the reader (see Section 1.2.3).</p><p>This book is thus a catalog, rather than a book to be read from cover to cover. I have tried to write each chapter in such a way that it can be read independently from the other chapters. (This is not always possible, however. Whenever a chapter requires that another chapter be read first, I say so in the chapter introduction.) Each chapter has an introduction that explains the general subject area of the chapter, summarizes the patterns in the chapter, and says what projects the patterns originated from. </p><p>How to Read this BookI suggest reading all of Chapter 1 first and then reading each chapter introduction. Then feel free to delve into the chapters in any order you like. If you are not familiar with the approach I take to modeling, or the notation and concepts I use, read the appendix. The Table of Patterns gives a brief summary of what each pattern is about, so you can use that to help you explore or to find a pattern when you come back to the book at a later time. It is important to stress that each pattern in this book is useful outside the domain that gave it birth. Thus I encourage you to look into chapters that you might think are outside your field of interest. For example, I found that models of observation and measurement designed for health care proved to be very useful for corporate financial analysis.</p><p>Who Should Read this BookThis book can be useful to a range of readers, although different readers will learn different things from it and may need some different preparations.I expect my biggest audience to be analysts and designers of object-oriented (OO) computer systems, particularly those working at the analysis end. Such readers should have made at least some use of an OO analysis and design method. This book does not provide any introduction to this subject, so I would suggest first reading a book on OO analysis and design if you are new to this field. I must stress that the patterns in this book are conceptual in nature, and I use a very conceptual approach to modeling. This leads to some stylistic differences from those texts that use a more implementation-based approach to modeling.</p><p>A small, but very important, audience consists of those people who act as domain experts for a modeling project. Such readers do not require a knowledge of computers but do need to know about conceptual modeling. One of the main reasons I use conceptual models in this book is to make things easier for this group of readers. The modeling project here may be analysis for computer system development or BPR. I have taught many professionals (including doctors, financial traders, accountants, nurses, and payroll supervisors) this kind of modeling and have found that a software background is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage to conceptual modeling. The business model patterns are as much about business modeling as they are about computer systems analysis (see Section 1.4). Any such reader should take a course on OO analysis that stresses the conceptual aspect. (Odell's book Martin, J., and J. Odell, Object-Oriented Methods: A Foundation, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1995 is particularly valuable in this respect.)</p><p>I hope many programmers will delve between these covers, although some programmers may take exception to the lack of code and the conceptual slant. For these readers I suggest you take particular note of Chapter 14, which should help to explain the relationship between the conceptual models and the resulting software. </p><p>This is an object-oriented book, and I do not hesitate in proclaiming my belief that the object-oriented approach is the superior way to develop software. These models, however, are primarily conceptual models, and many data modelers have had a long tradition of using conceptual (or logical) models. Data modelers should find many of the patterns useful, particularly if they use more advanced semantic techniques. The object-oriented features of the models will reveal many of the differences between object-oriented and traditional approaches. I would encourage such readers to use this book in conjunction with an OO analysis book that stresses the conceptual side of modeling and the links between OO and semantic data modeling.</p><p>Managers will find the book useful as a starting point for development activity. Starting from a pattern can help to clarify goals, and project planning can take advantage of the broad ground that patterns map out.</p><p>I have not aimed this book at students. I've written it more for the professional software engineer. I hope, however, that some students will take a look. When I was learning analysis and design, I found it difficult because there were few good examples I could learn from, examples that came out of the world outside the university. Just as looking at good code can teach you a lot about programming, looking at good models can teach you a lot about analysis and design.</p><p>A Living BookEvery author I know shares a frustration: Once a book is published it is fixed. The book spreads its advice around the community, yet the author has little way of expressing changes. I know how much I keep learning, and I am sure this learning will modify my ideas. I want these changes to be passed on to my readers.</p><p>With this book, Addison-Wesley will provide a web site which will be used to pass on further materials to keep this book alive. At this stage I am not sure exactly what it will contain, but I expect the following:</p><p>any new things I learn about the patterns in the book</p><p> answers to questions about the book</p><p>useful commentary from others about the patterns</p><p>new analysis patterns by myself, and by others</p><p>When the Unified Modeling Notation appears (or whatever it is called by then) I will redraw all the diagrams in the book in the new notation and put them on the site.</p><p>This site will be a complement to the book, so keep an eye on it and use it to let me know how to improve and develop the ideas between these pages.</p><p>AcknowledgmentsAny author is indebted to many others who help.

The Atoms First approach provides a consistent and logical method for teaching general chemistry. This approach starts with the fundamental building block of matter, the atom, and uses it as the stepping stone to understanding more complex chemistry topics. Once mastery of the nature of atoms and electrons is achieved, the formation and properties of compounds are developed. Only after the study of matter and the atom will students have sufficient background to fully engage in topics such as stoichiometry, kinetics, equilibrium, and thermodynamics. Thus, the Atoms First approach empowers instructors to present the most complete and compelling story of general chemistry. Far from a simple re-ordering of topics, this is a book that will truly meet the needs of the growing atoms-first market. The third edition continues to build on the innovative success of the first and second editions. Changes to this edition include specific refinements intended to augment the student-centered pedagogical features that continue to make this book effective and popular both with professors, and with their students.</p><p>Jason Overby received his B.S. in chemistry and political science from the University of Tennessee at Martin, his Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry from Vanderbilt University, and conducted postdoctoral research at Dartmouth College.

Clarke once wrote that any sufficiently advanced civilization would possess seemingly magical powers to a lesser-advanced one. Technology, and in particular computer technology, has and always will present a Janus head to the world. While delivering enormous capability and freedom, the instrumentality by which that freedom is delivered becomes even more arcane and obscurantist to the users of that technology. The backyard auto mechanic is an artifact. We are all, including most mechanics, relegated to simply filling the gas tank, changing the oil or replacing the occasional black box. And what of those practitioners of these arcane arts, who in designing and building the devices which channel electrons to the exacting demands of industry and consumers seem to take on almost a mantle of priesthood? Any priesthood needs a catechism, and Douglas J. Smith's HDL Chip Design might well fit that role. This publication is designed as an introduction to and reference on using the two industry standard hardware description languages (HDL's) VDHL and Verilog to design, simulate and synthesize Applications-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) and Field Programmable Gate-Arrays (FPGA). Emphasis for modeling is at the RT (register transfer) level, using a top-down design method. This reviewer approached this text as a student with a physics background and an interest in glimpsing the inner sanctum of chip design and came away impressed with its clarity, depth, and no-nonsense approach. This is not a book for the fainthearted neophyte, but a challenging and rewarding introduction to HDL chip design, and a treasury as a reference book to the practicing professional. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>Mathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics (3rd Edition) (Featured Titles for Transition to Advanced Mathematics)</h2><p><p> <b>Mathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics, Third Edition</b>, prepares students for the more abstract mathematics courses that follow calculus.

He is professor emeritus at the University of Puerto Rico.<b>The Disk</b><p>I am a woodcutter. My name doesn't matter. The hut I was born in, and where I'm soon to die, sits at the edge of the woods. They say these woods go on and on, right to the ocean that surrounds the entire world; they say that wooden houses like mine travel on that ocean. I wouldn't know; I've never seen it. I've not seen the <i>other</i> side of the woods, either. My older brother, when we were boys he made me swear that between the two of us we'd hack away at this woods till there wasn't a tree left standing. My brother is dead now, and now it's something else I'm after, and always will be. Over in the direction where the sun goes down there's a creek I fish in with my hands. There are wolves in the woods, but the wolves don't scare me, and my ax has never failed me. I've not kept track of how old I am, but I know I'm old&#x2014;my eyes don't see anymore. Down in the village, which I don't venture into anymore because I'd lose my way, everyone says I'm a miser, but how much could a woodcutter have saved up? </p><p>I keep the door of my house shut with a rock so the snow won't get in. One evening I heard heavy, dragging footsteps and then a knock. I opened the door and a stranger came in. He was a tall, elderly man all wrapped up in a worn-out old blanket. A scar sliced across his face. The years looked to have given him more authority than frailty, but even so I saw it was hard for him to walk without leaning on his stick. We exchanged a few words I don't recall now. The finally the man said: </p><p> &#x201c;I am without a home, and I sleep wherever I can. I have wandered all across Saxony.&#x201d; </p><p>His words befitted his age. My father always talked about &#x201c;Saxony&#x201d;; now people call it England. </p><p>There was bread and some fish in the house. While we ate, we didn't talk. It started raining. I took some skins and made him a pallet on the dirt floor where my brother had died. When night came we slept. </p><p>It was toward dawn when we left the house. The rain had stopped and the ground was covered with new snow. The man dropped his stick and he ordered me to pick it up. </p><p> &#x201c;Why should I do what you tell me to?&#x201d; I said to him. </p><p> &#x201c;Because I am a king,&#x201d; he answered. </p><p>I thought he was mad. I picked up the stick and gave it to him. </p><p>With his next words, his voice was changed. </p><p> &#x201c;I am the king of the Secgans. Many times did I lead them to victory in hard combat, but at the hour that fate decreed, I lost my kingdom. My name is Isern and I am of the line of Odin.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;I do not worship Odin,&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;I worship Christ.&#x201d; </p><p>He went on as though he'd not heard me. </p><p> &#x201c;I wander the paths of exile, but still I am king, for I have the disk. Do you want to see it?&#x201d; </p><p>He opened his hand and showed me his bony palm. There was nothing in it. His hand was empty. It was only then that I realized he'd always kept it shut tight. </p><p>He looked me in the eye. </p><p> &#x201c;You may touch it.&#x201d; </p><p>I had my doubts, but I reached out and with my fingertips I touched his palm. I felt something cold, and I saw a quick gleam. His hand snapped shut. I said nothing. </p><p> &#x201c;It is the disk of Odin,&#x201d; the old man said in a patient voice, as though he were speaking to a child. &#x201c;It had but one side. There is not another thing on earth that has but one side. So long as I hold it in my hand I shall be king.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Is it gold?&#x201d; I said. </p><p> &#x201c;I know not. It is the disk of Odin and it has but one side.&#x201d; </p><p>It was then I felt a gnawing to own the disk myself. If it were mine, I could sell it for a bar of gold and then <i>I</i> would be a king. </p><p> &#x201c;In my hut I've got a chest full of money hidden away. Gold coins, and they shine like my ax,&#x201d; I told the wanderer, whom I hate to this day. &#x201c;If you give the disk of Odin to me, I will give you the chest.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;I will not,&#x201d; he said gruffly. </p><p> &#x201c;Then you can continue on your way,&#x201d; I said. </p><p>He turned away. One ax blow to the back of his head was all it took; he wavered and fell, but as he fell he opened his hand, and I saw the gleam of the disk in the air. I marked the place with my ax and I dragged the body down to the creek bed, where I knew the creek was swollen. There I dumped his body. </p><p>When I got back to my house I looked for the disk. But I couldn't find it. I have been looking for it for years.</p></p><h2>Germinal</h2><p>Zola&#39;s 1885 masterpiece of everyday relationships and working life exposes the inhuman conditions of miners in northern France in the 1860s.

Unlike many other editions of Leaves of Grass, which reproduce various short, early versions, this Modern Library Paperback Classics &#34;Death-bed&#34; edition presents everything Whitman wrote in its final form, and includes newly commissioned notes.</p><p>One of the great innovative figures in American letters, Walt Whitman created a daringly new kind of poetry that became a major force in world literature. <i>Leaves Of Grass</i> is his one book. First published in 1855 with only twelve poems, it was greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the wonderful gift . . . the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Over the course of Whitman's life, the book reappeared in many versions, expanded and transformed as the author's experiences and the nation's history changed and grew. Whitman's ambition was to creates something uniquely American. In that he succeeded. His poems have been woven into the very fabric of the American character. From his solemn masterpieces "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" to the joyous freedom of "Song of Myself," "I Sing the Body Electric," and "Song of the Open Road," Whitman's work lives on, an inspiration to the poets of later generations.It is not only the allusions to sex and physiology that disturbed Whitman&#39;s critics but also his departure from the rules of conventional poetry. He broke down the standard metred line, discard the obligatory rhyming scheme, and freely expressed himself in the living vernacular of American speech.</p><h2>Sociology Matters</h2><p>Sociology Matters, Seventh Edition, is intended for instructors who desire an especially short, relatively inexpensive introductory text and a concise introduction to the discipline of sociology.

She also discovered that writers, not editors, have the most interesting and useful things to say about the making and the meaning of fiction. Accordingly, her choice of fiction in the first edition of her <i>The Story and Its Writer</i> was as notable for its student appeal as it was for its quality and range. And to complement these stories, she introduced a lasting innovation: an array of the writers' own commentaries on the craft and traditions of the short story. In subsequent editions her sense of what works was confirmed as the book evolved into the most comprehensive, diverse -- and bestselling -- introduction to fiction anthology. Instructors rely on Ann Charters' ability to assemble an authoritative and teachable anthology, and anticipate each edition's selection of new writers and stories.<br><br></p><p><br><br><b>ANN CHARTERS</b> (Ph.D., Columbia University) is a professor of English at the University of Connecticut and has taught courses in the short story for over thirty years.

First settled by migrating Native Americans about 1720 and later by white Americans, Ohio became the crucible which set Indian and military policy throughout the region. There, Shawnees, Wyandots, and Delawares, among others, fought to preserve their land claims. A land of opportunity, refuge, and violence for both Indians and whites, Ohio served as the political, economic, and social foundation for the settlement of the Old Northwest.</p><p>A Selection of the History Book ClubIn the first major reassessment of the Ohio frontier period in more than fifty years, R. Douglas Hurt provides a sweeping narrative of the major military, social, economic, and political developments in the region from the arrival of the first Native American settlers to the end of the frontier period. He traces the settlement of the Shawnees, Delawares, and Wyandots among other Native American groups and discusses their culture and adaptation to white society. He also details the military expeditions of Arthur St. Clair, Josiah Harmar, Anthony Wayne, and William Henry Harrison during the bloody conflicts fought to determine which people would control the land north of the Ohio River. Hurt also traces the survey of the Seven Ranges and discusses the settlement of the Ohio Company&#39;s lands, the Western Reserve, the Miami Purchase, the Virginia Military Tract, and the French village of Gallipolis. The Ohio frontier also lured those seeking a religious haven. Although many frontier people - such as the Shakers, Quakers, and Zoarites - wanted little more than to believe as they pleased and to be left alone, strong Protestant and utopian sects made Ohio their home. This study also discusses the major political concerns of the territorial and early statehood periods, including the War of 1812 and the presidential elections of 1824 and 1828.</p><h2>The Hollywood Book Club: (Portrait Photography Books, Coffee Table Books, Hollywood History, Old Hollywood Glamour, Celebrity Photography)</h2><p>Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, Gregory Peck, Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe&#x2014;the brightest stars of the silver screen couldn't resist curling up with a good book.

A distinct project that sets the tone for his subsequent lectures, <i>How to Live Together</i> is a key introduction to Barthes's pedagogical methods and critical worldview.<br><br>In this work, Barthes focuses on the concept of "idiorrhythmy," a productive form of living together in which one recognizes and respects the individual rhythms of the other. He explores this phenomenon through five texts that represent different living spaces and their associated ways of life: �mile Zola's <i>Pot-Bouille</i>, set in a Parisian apartment building; Thomas Mann's <i>The Magic Mountain</i>, which takes place in a sanatorium; Andr� Gide's <i>La S�questr�e de Poitiers</i>, based on the true story of a woman confined to her bedroom; Daniel Defoe's <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, about a castaway on a remote island; and Pallidius's <i>Lausiac History</i>, detailing the ascetic lives of the desert fathers. <br><br>As with his previous lecture books, <i>How to Live Together</i> exemplifies Barthes's singular approach to teaching, in which he invites his audience to investigate with him&#x2015;or for him&#x2015;and wholly incorporates his listeners into his discoveries. Rich with playful observations and suggestive prose, <i>How to Live Together</i> orients English-speaking readers to the full power of Barthes's intellectual adventures.</p><p>Roland Barthes (1915&#x2013;1980) was a French literary theorist, philosopher, critic, and semiotician whose work has been central to the delineation and development of numerous schools of theory, including structuralism, semiotics, existentialism, social theory, Marxism, anthropology, and post-structuralism. His books include <i>The Preparation of the Novel: Lecture Courses and Seminars at the Coll�ge de France (1978&#x2013;1979 and 1979&#x2013;1980)</i>; <i>The Neutral: Lecture Course at the College de France (1977&#x2013;1978)</i>; <i>Mythologies</i>; <i>S/Z</i>; <i>A Lover's Discourse</i>; and <i>Camera Lucida</i>.<br><br>Kate Briggs is the translator of Roland Barthes's <i>The Preparation of the Novel: Lecture Courses and Seminars at the College de France (1978&#x2013;1979 and 1979&#x2013;1980)</i>.This is Roland Barthes at his inventive and idiosyncratic best: a brilliant and suggestive reader, both of literary texts and the social, psychic, and affective spaces of everyday life. (Diana Knight, University of Nottingham)</p><h2>Introduction to Graph Theory</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book fills a need for a thorough introduction to graph theory that features both the understanding and writing of proofs about graphs. Verification that algorithms work is emphasized more than their complexity. <b> </b> An effective use of examples, and huge number of interesting exercises, demonstrate the topics of trees and distance, matchings and factors, connectivity and paths, graph coloring, edges and cycles, and planar graphs. <b> </b> For those who need to learn to make coherent arguments in the fields of mathematics and computer science. </p></p><p><p><b>Preface</b></p> <p> Graph theory is a delightful playground for the exploration of proof techniques in discrete mathematics, and its results have applications in many areas of the computing, social, and natural sciences. The design of this book permits usage in a one-semester introduction at the undergraduate or beginning graduate level, or in a patient two-semester introduction. No previous knowledge of graph theory is assumed. Many algorithms and applications are included, but the focus is on understanding the structure of graphs and the techniques used to analyze problems in graph theory. </p> <p> Many textbooks have been written about graph theory. Due to its emphasis on both proofs and applications, the initial model for this book was the elegant text by J.A. Bondy and US.R. Murty, <i>Graph Theory with Applications</i> (Macmillan/NorthHolland 1976). Graph theory is still young, and no consensus has emerged on how the introductory material should be presented. Selection and order of topics, choice of proofs, objectives, and underlying themes are matters of lively debate. Revising this book dozens of times has taught me the difficulty of these decisions. This book is my contribution to the debate. </p> <p><b>The Second Edition</b></p> <p> The revision for the second edition emphasizes making the text easier for the students to learn from and easier for the instructor to teach from. There have not been great changes in the overall content of the book, but the presentation has been modified to make the material more accessible, especially in the early parts of the book. Some of the changes are discussed in more detail later in this preface; here I provide a brief summary. </p> <ul> <li>Optional material within non-optional sections is now designated by (*); such material is not used later and can be skipped. Most of it is <i>intended</i> to be skipped in a one-semester course. When a subsection is marked "optional", the entire subsection is optional, and hence no individual items are starred.</li> <li>For less-experienced students, Appendix A has been added as a reference summary of helpful material on sets, logical statements, induction, counting arguments, binomial coefficients, relations, and the pigeonhole principle.</li> <li>Many proofs have been reworded in more patient language with additional details, and more examples have been added.</li> <li>More than 350 exercises have been added, mostly easier exercises in Chapters 1-7. There are now more than 1200 exercises.</li> <li>More than 100 illustrations have been added; there are now more than 400. In illustrations showing several types of edges, the switch to bold and solid edges instead of solid and dashed edges has increased clarity.</li> <li>Easier.problems are now grouped at the beginning of each exercise section, usable as warm-ups. Statements of some exercises have been clarified.</li> <li>In addition to hints accompanying the exercise statements, there is now an appendix of supplemental hints.</li> <li>For easier access, terms being defined are in bold type, and the vast majority of them appear in Definition items.</li> <li>For easier access, the glossary of notation has been placed on the inside covers.</li> <li>Material involving Eulerian circuits, digraphs, and Tur�n's Theorem has been relocated to facilitate more efficient learning.</li> <li>Chapters 6 and 7 have been switched to introduce the idea of planarity earlier, and the section on complexity has become an appendix.</li> <li>The glossary has been improved to eliminate errors and to emphasize items more directly related to the text.</li> </ul> <p><b>Features</b></p> <p> Various features of this book facilitate students' efforts to understand the material. There is discussion of proof techniques, more than 1200 exercises of varying difficulty, more than 400 illustrations, and many examples. Proofs are presented in full in the text. </p> <p> Many undergraduates begin a course in graph theory with little exposure to proof techniques. Appendix A provides background reading that will help them get started. Students who have difficulty understanding or writing proofs in the early material should be encouraged to read this appendix in conjunction with Chapter 1. Some discussion of proof techniques still appears in the early sections of the text (especially concerning induction), but an expanded treatment of the basic background (especially concerning sets, functions, relations, and elementary counting) is now in Appendix A. </p> <p> Most of the exercises require proofs. Many undergraduates have had little practice at presenting explanations, and this hinders their appreciation of graph theory and other mathematics. The intellectual discipline of justifying an argument is valuable independently of mathematics; I hope that students will appreciate this. In writing solutions to exercises, students should be careful in their use of language ("say what you mean"), and they should be intellectually honest ("mean what you say"). </p> <p> Although many terms in graph theory suggest their definitions, the quantity of terminology remains an obstacle to fluency. Mathematicians like to gather definitions at the start, but most students succeed better if they use a concept before receiving the next. This, plus experience and requests from reviewers, has led me to postpone many definitions until they are needed. For example, the definition of cartesian product appears in Section 5.1 with coloring problems. Line graphs are defined in Section 4.2 with Menger's Theorem and in Section 7.1 with edge-coloring. The definitions of induced subgraph and join have now been postponed to Section 1.2 and Section 3.1, respectively. </p> <p> I have changed the treatment of digraphs substantially by postponing their introduction to Section 1.4. Introducing digraphs at the same time as graphs tends to confuse or overwhelm 'students. Waiting to the end of Chapter 1 allows them to become comfortable with basic concepts in the context of a single model. The discussion of digraphs then reinforces some of those concepts while clarifying the distinctions. The two models are still discussed together in the material on connectivity. </p> <p> This book contains more material than most introductory texts in graph theory. Collecting the advanced material as a final optional chapter of "additional topics" permits usage at different levels. The undergraduate introduction consists of the first seven chapters (omitting most optional material), leaving Chapter 8 as topical reading for interested students. A graduate course can treat most of Chapters 1 and 2 as recommended reading, moving rapidly to Chapter 3 in class and reaching some topics in Chapter 8. Chapter 8 can also be used as the basis for a second course in graph theory, along with material that was optional in earlier chapters. </p> <p> Many results in graph theory have several proofs; illustrating this can increase students' flexibility in trying multiple approaches to a problem. I include some alternative proofs as remarks and others as exercises. </p> <p> Many exercises have hints, some given with the exercise statement and others in Appendix C. Exercises marked "(-)" or "(+)" are easier or more difficult, respectively, than unmarked problems. Those marked "(+)" should not be assigned as homework in a typical undergraduate course. Exercises marked "(!)" are especially valuable, instructive, or entertaining. Those marked "(*)" use material labeled optional in the text. </p> <p> Each exercise section begins with a set of "(-)" exercises, ordered according to the material in the section and ending with a line of bullets. These exercises either check understanding of concepts or are immediate applications of results in the section. I recommend some of these to my class as "warmup" exercises to check their understanding before working the main homework problems, most of which are marked "(!)". Most problems marked "(-)" are good exam questions. When using other exercises on exams, it may be a good idea to provide hints from Appendix C. </p> <p> Exercises that relate several concepts appear when the last is introduced. Many pointers to exercises appear in the text where relevant concepts are discussed. An exercise in the current section is cited by giving only its item number among the exercises of that section. Other cross-references are by Chapter. Section. Item. </p> <p><b>Organization and Modification</b></p> <p> In the first edition, I sought a development that was intellectually coherent and displayed a gradual (not monotonic) increase in difficulty of proofs and in algorithmic complexity. </p> <p> Carrying this further in the second edition, Eulerian circuits and Hamiltonian cycles are now even farther apart. The simple characterization of Eulerian circuits is now in Section 1.2 with material closely related to it. The remainder of the former Section 2.4 has been dispersed to relevant locations in other sections, with Fleury's Algorithm dropped. </p> <p> Chapter 1 has been substantially rewritten. I continue to avoid the term "multigraph"; it causes more trouble than it resolves, because many students assume that a multigraph <i>must</i> have multiple edges. It is less distracting to append the word "simple" where needed and keep "graph" as the general object, with occasional statements that in particular contexts it makes sense to consider only simple graphs. </p> <p> The treatment of definitions in Chapter 1 has been made more friendly and precise, particularly those involving paths, trails, and walks. The informal groupings of basic definitions in Section 1.1 have been replaced by Definition items that help students find definitions more easily. </p> <p> In addition to the material on isomorphism, Section 1.1 now has a more precise treatment of the Petersen graph and an explicit introduction of the notions of decomposition and girth. This provides language that facilitates later discussion in various places, and it permits interesting explicit questions other than isomorphism. </p> <p> Sections 1.2-1.4 have become more coherent. The treatment of Eulerian circuits motivates and completes Section 1.2. Some material has been removed from Section 1.3 to narrow its focus to degrees and counting, and this section has acquired the material on vertex degrees that had been in Section 1.4. Section 1.4 now provides the introduction to digraphs and can be treated lightly. </p> <p> Trees and distance appear together in Chapter 2 due to the many relations between these topics. Many exercises combine these notions, and algorithms to compute distances produce or use trees. </p> <p> Most graph theorists agree that the K�nig-Egerv�ry Theorem deserves an independent proof without network flow. Also, students have trouble distinguishing "<i>k</i>-connected" from "connectivity <i>k</i>", which have the same relationship as "<i>k</i>-colorable" and "chromatic number <i>k</i>". I therefore treat matching first and later use matching to prove Menger's Theorem. Both matching and connectivity are used in the coloring material. </p> <p> In response to requests from a number of users, I have added a short optional subsection on dominating sets at the end of Section 3.1. The material on weighted bipartite matching has been clarified by emphasis on vertex cover instead of augmenting path and by better use of examples. </p> <p> Tur�n's Theorem uses only elementary ideas about vertex degrees and induction and hence appeared in Chapter 1 in the first edition. This caused some difficulties, because it was the most abstract item up to that point and students felt somewhat overwhelmed by it. Thus I have kept the simple triangle-free case (Mantel's Theorem) in Section 1.3 and have moved the full theorem to Section 5.2 under the viewpoint of extremal problems related to coloring. </p> <p> The chapter on planarity now comes before that on "Edges and Cycles". When an instructor is short of time, planarity is more important to reach than the material on edge-coloring and Hamiltonian cycles. The questions involved in planarity appeal intuitively to students due to their visual aspects, and many students have encountered these questions before. Also, the ideas involved in discussing planar graphs seem more intellectually broadening in relation to the earlier material of the course than the ideas used to prove the basic results on edge-coloring and Hamiltonian cycles. </p> <p> Finally, discussing planarity first makes the material of Chapter 7 more coherent. The new arrangement permits a more thorough discussion of the relationships among planarity, edge-coloring, and Hamiltonian cycles, leading naturally beyond the Four Color Theorem to the optional new material on nowhere-zero flows as a dual concept to coloring. </p> <p> When students discover that the coloring and Hamiltonian cycle problems lack good algorithms, many become curious about NP-completeness. Appendix B satisfies this curiosity. Presentation of NP-completeness via formal languages can be technically abstract, so some students appreciate a presentation in the context of graph problems. NP-completeness proofs also illustrate the variety and usefulness of "graph transformation" arguments. </p> <p> The text explores relationships among fundamental results. Petersen's Theorem on 2-factors (Chapter 3) uses Eulerian circuits and bipartite matching. The equivalence between Menger's Theorem and the Max Flow-Min Cut Theorem is explored more fully than in the first edition, and the "Baseball Elimination" application is now treated in more depth. The <i>k</i> &#x2014; 1-connectedness of <i>k</i>-color-critical graphs (Chapter 5) uses bipartite matching. Section 5.3 offers a brief introduction to perfect graphs, emphasizing chordal graphs. Additional features of this text in comparison to some others include the algorithmic proof of Vizing's Theorem and the proof of Kuratowski's Theorem by Thomassen's methods. </p> <p> There are various other additions and improvements in the first seven chapters. There is now a brief discussion of Heawood's Formula and the Robertson-Seymour Theorem at the end of Chapter 6. In Section 7.1, a proof of Shannon's bound on the edge-chromatic number has been added. In Section 5.3, the characterization of chordal graphs is somewhat simpler than before by proving a stronger result about simplicial vertices. In Section 6.3, the proof of the reducibility of the Birkhoff diamond has been eliminated, but a brief discussion of discharging has been added. The material discussing issues in the proof of the theorem is optional, and the aim is to give the flavor of the approach without getting into detailed arguments. From this viewpoint the reducibility proof seemed out of focus. </p> <p> Chapter 8 contains highlights of advanced material and is not intended for an undergraduate course. It assumes more sophistication than earlier chapters and is written more tersely. Its sections are independent; each selects appealing results from a large topic that merits a chapter of its own. Some of these sections become more difficult near the end; an instructor may prefer to sample early material in several sections rather than present one completely. </p> <p> There may be occasional relationships between items in Chapter 8 and items marked optional in the first seven chapters, but generally cross-references indicate the connections. The material of Chapter 8 has not changed substantially since the first edition, although many corrections have been made and the presentation has been clarified in many places. </p> <p> I will treat advanced graph theory more thoroughly in <i>The Art of Combinatoracs.</i> Volume I is devoted to extremal graph theory and Volume II to structure of graphs. Volume III has chapters on matroids and integer programming (including network flow). Volume IV emphasizes methods in combinatorics and discusses ...</p></p><h2>Buen Viaje!

Harris offers a vivid historical tour of mankind's willingness to suspend reason in favor of religious beliefs, even when those beliefs are used to justify harmful behavior and sometimes heinous crimes. He asserts that in the shadow of weapons of mass destruction, we can no longer tolerate views that pit one true god against another. Most controversially, he argues that we cannot afford moderate lip service to religion&#x2015;an accommodation that only blinds us to the real perils of fundamentalism. While warning against the encroachment of organized religion into world politics, Harris also draws on new evidence from neuroscience and insights from philosophy to explore spirituality as a biological, brain-based need. He calls on us to invoke that need in taking a secular humanistic approach to solving the problems of this world.</p><p>Sam Harris cranks out blunt, hard-hitting chapters to make his case for why faith itself is the most dangerous element of modern life. And if the devil's in the details, then you'll find Satan waiting at the back of the book in the very substantial notes section where Harris saves his more esoteric discussions to avoid sidetracking the urgency of his message. <p> Interestingly, Harris is not just focused on debunking religious faith, though he makes his compelling arguments with verve and intellectual clarity. <i>The End of Faith</i> is also a bit of a philosophical Swiss Army knife. Once he has presented his arguments on why, in an age of Weapons of Mass Destruction, belief is now a hazard of great proportions, he focuses on proposing alternate approaches to the mysteries of life. Harris recognizes the truth of the human condition, that we fear death, and we often crave "something more" we cannot easily define, and which is not met by accumulating more material possessions. But by attempting to provide the cure for the ills it defines, the book bites off a bit more than it can comfortably chew in its modest page count (however the rich Bibliography provides more than enough background for an intrigued reader to follow up for months on any particular strand of the author' musings.) </p><p> Harris' heart is not as much in the latter chapters, though, but in presenting his main premise. Simply stated, any belief system that speaks with assurance about the hereafter has the potential to place far less value on the here and now. And thus the corollary -- when death is simply a door translating us from one existence to another, it loses its sting and finality. Harris pointedly asks us to consider that those who do not fear death for themselves, and who also revere ancient scriptures instructing them to mete it out generously to others, may soon have these weapons in their own hands. If thoughts along the same line haunt you, this is your book.--<i>Ed Dobeas</i></p>Sam Harris is a graduate in philosophy from Stanford University.</p><h2>Popular Culture: A Reader</h2><p><p><b>Popular Culture: A Reader</b> helps students understand the pervasive role of popular culture and the processes that constitute it as a product of industry,&nbsp;an intellectual object of inquiry, and&nbsp;an integral component of all our lives.</p><p></p><p>The volume is divided into 7 thematic sections, and each section is preceded by an introduction which engages with, and critiques, the chapters that follow.

On the surface, this is a horrifying tale of colonial exploitation. The narrator, Marlowe journeys on business deep into the heart of Africa. But there he encounters Kurtz, an idealist apparently crazed and depraved by his power over the natives, and the meeting prompts Marlowe to reflect on the darkness at the heart of all men. This short but complex and often ambiguous story, which has been the basis of several films and plays, continues to provoke interpretation and discussion.<br><br><i>Heart of Darkness</i> grew out of a journey Joseph Conrad took up the Congo River; the verisimilitude that the great novelist thereby brought to his most famous tale everywhere enhances its dense and shattering power.<br><br>Apparently a sailor&#x2019;s yarn, it is in fact a grim parody of the adventure story, in which the narrator, Marlow, travels deep into the heart of the Congo where he encounters the crazed idealist Kurtz and discovers that the relative values of the civilized and the primitive are not what they seem. <i>Heart of Darkness</i> is a model of economic storytelling, an indictment of the inner and outer turmoil caused by the European imperial misadventure, and a piercing account of the fragility of the human soul.<br><br></p></p><p>The story of Marlow travelling upriver in central Africa to find Kurtz, an ivory agent as consumed by the horror of human life as he is by physical illness, has long been considered a classic, and continues to be widely read and studied.<br>This edition, edited by one of the leading figures in "the Conrad controversy", includes an introduction and explanatory notes, as well as a fascinating variety of contemporary documents. The introduction and bibliography have been updated, and two new appendices have been added; the second of these is a selection of Alice Harris's extraordinary but little-known photographs documenting the horrors of colonialism in turn-of-the-century Congo.For generations an exclusively white community of literary critics treated a variety of thematic and stylistic issues (often with great subtlety and insight) while ignoring &#34;Heart of Darkness&#34; as a commentary on imperialism and racism.

O</p><h2>Notes on the Synthesis of Form (Harvard Paperbacks)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;These notes are about the process of design: the process of inventing things which display new physical order, organization, form, in response to function.&#x201d; This book, opening with these words, presents an entirely new theory of the process of design.</p><p>In the first part of the book, Christopher Alexander discusses the process by which a form is adapted to the context of human needs and demands that has called it into being. He shows that such an adaptive process will be successful only if it proceeds piecemeal instead of all at once. It is for this reason that forms from traditional un-self-conscious cultures, molded not by designers but by the slow pattern of changes within tradition, are so beautifully organized and adapted. When the designer, in our own self-conscious culture, is called on to create a form that is adapted to its context he is unsuccessful, because the preconceived categories out of which he builds his picture of the problem do not correspond to the inherent components of the problem, and therefore lead only to the arbitrariness, willfulness, and lack of understanding which plague the design of modern buildings and modern cities.</p><p>In the second part, Mr. Alexander presents a method by which the designer may bring his full creative imagination into play, and yet avoid the traps of irrelevant preconception. He shows that, whenever a problem is stated, it is possible to ignore existing concepts and to create new concepts, out of the structure of the problem itself, which do correspond correctly to what he calls the subsystems of the adaptive process. By treating each of these subsystems as a separate subproblem, the designer can translate the new concepts into form. The form, because of the process, will be well-adapted to its context, non-arbitrary, and correct.</p><p>The mathematics underlying this method, based mainly on set theory, is fully developed in a long appendix. Another appendix demonstrates the application of the method to the design of an Indian village.</p></p><p>&#x201c;One of the most important contemporary books about the art of design, what it is, and how to go about it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Industrial Design</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Christopher Alexander has outlined an ambitious proposal that could revolutionize the approach to architectural design...

But since much of what&#x2019;s available in the supermarket is full of chemicals and devoid of any real nutrients, taking control of what we eat and making sure it comes from nature, not a factory, strikes me as a good idea. I&#x2019;m fortunate to live in Washington, D.C., where farmers&#x2019; markets and community supported agriculture (CSA) shares are plentiful, so moving to an actual farm may seem a little extreme. My real motivation is that I want my daughter to grow up dirty, literally&#x2014;as in easy on the soap and shampoo, heavy on the mucky animal chores. I shared her saga of antibiotic misadventure in my first book, <i>Gutbliss</i>. Since then, I&#x2019;ve seen hundreds of patients with stories similar to hers, and I&#x2019;ve become even more convinced that damage to the microbiome&#x2014;the trillions of organisms that call our digestive tract home&#x2014;is at the root of many of our current health problems. Figuring out how to undo that damage and &#x201c;rewild&#x201d; ourselves has become a focus of my medical practice and a personal journey in our household. Living a little dirtier and eating a little cleaner is definitely part of the fix.</p><p>Unwilding Ourselves</p><p>Our ancestors had a symbiotic relationship with their microbes that evolved over millions of years and served them well. They were benevolent hosts to a dense jungle of microscopic creatures, including worms and other parasites that actually contributed to their health. Large predators and the absence of food were their main threats, not the hundreds of diseases that afflict us today. The irony is that as we&#x2019;ve &#x201c;unwilded&#x201d; our bodies and our environment in an effort to become healthier, we&#x2019;ve actually become a lot sicker in some important ways.</p><p>Urbanization and modern medicine have undoubtedly improved our lives, but they&#x2019;ve also introduced practices&#x2014;overuse of antibiotics, chlorination of the water supply, processed foods full of chemicals and hormones, microbe-depleting pesticides, increasing rates of Cesarean sections&#x2014;that have ravaged our microbiome, diminishing the total number of organisms as well as the diversity of species. The result is an increase in a wide range of modern plagues, including asthma, allergies, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, obesity, cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, and heart disease. The rise of these diseases is inextricably intertwined with the full-on assault on our microbiome resulting from our super-sanitized lifestyle.</p><p>A decade ago, who knew that every antibiotic dispensed during cold and flu season was potentially bringing us one step closer to a diagnosis of Crohn&#x2019;s disease, or making us fatter? None of us doing the prescribing realized that we might be paving the way to real illness in our well-meaning attempts to cure the sniffles. The prevailing wisdom was&#x2014;and to some extent still is&#x2014;that germs are bad and we should get rid of them, and antibiotics are good and we should use them. And use them we have: the average American child will receive more than a dozen courses of antibiotics before reaching college, primarily for minor illnesses that require no treatment at all. Despite the tremendous amount of research in the last few years connecting the dots, many physicians and their patients remain in the dark, blaming each manifestation of microbial discord on bad luck or bad genes, never questioning or understanding the root cause.</p><p>Less Is Often More</p><p>My own understanding came only after my daughter was treated with antibiotics at birth and throughout infancy, setting off a series of events that, a decade later, continue to affect her health. I had been trained at world-class institutions and practiced gastroenterology at a leading teaching hospital, but, like most physicians, I had no idea that the antibiotics I thought were so helpful were actually creating illness by decimating her microbiome at a time when it was most vulnerable, making her more susceptible to infection and inflammation. I wish I had known then what I know now and what I continue to learn every day: that illness is often the result of a decreased, not increased, bacterial load, and that less is sometimes more when it comes to medical intervention.</p><p>Rehab for Your Microbiome</p><p>Every day in my gastroenterology practice I see patients with the telltale signs of a disordered microbiome: bloating, leaky gut, irritable bowel, gluten intolerance, Crohn&#x2019;s disease, ulcerative colitis, eczema, thyroid disorders, weight problems, fatigue, and brain fog. It&#x2019;s a veritable epidemic of &#x201c;missing microbes,&#x201d; as infectious disease specialist Martin Blaser, MD, describes it. The symptoms vary, but the history doesn&#x2019;t: overzealous use of antibiotics, often accompanied by a highly processed Western diet low in indigestible plant fiber&#x2014;the preferred food of gut bacteria.</p><p>Repopulating the microbiome can be a challenging process, but the good news is that most people do get better. Your microbes are constantly changing and evolving, and even if they&#x2019;ve been severely damaged by medications, infection, or diet, paying attention to what you put in and on your body can yield huge improvements. The microbiome you have today isn&#x2019;t the one you were born with, nor is it the one you&#x2019;ll have next year or even next week. It&#x2019;s highly dynamic, constantly changing and adjusting in response to your internal and external environment.</p><p>In medical school, I was taught how to eradicate people&#x2019;s germs. A quarter-century later, I&#x2019;m teaching my patients how to restore theirs: which foods to eat, how to care for their bodies and their homes without stripping away their microbes, what questions to ask when their doctor recommends an antibiotic, and whether a probiotic or even a stool transplant might be of benefit. These, I believe, are the new and essential survival skills for thriving in our super-clean era. You&#x2019;ll find them all in the Live Dirty, Eat Clean Plan at the end of this book.</p><p>When Dirty Children Grow into Clean Adults&#x2014;My Rewilding Journey</p><p>I spent my early childhood in the tropics, eating food from my grandfather&#x2019;s farm grown in rich soil fertilized by a herd of goats (which we sometimes also ate) instead of chemicals. We lived in the hilly suburbs and roamed around outside with our dog after school, exploring gullies, picking mangoes and oranges from the fruit trees in our backyard, and acquiring the occasional case of pinworm as a result of our barefoot explorations. In our household there was lots of attention paid to schoolwork and athletics, but shoes, showers, and shampoos were more or less optional. My father was an orthopedic surgeon whose great fear was that his children would grow up to be hypochondriacs, so his medical advice for whatever ailed us&#x2014;from the flu to a sprained ankle&#x2014;was always the same: go lie down and you&#x2019;ll feel better in the morning. We were vaccinated for the big stuff (polio and smallpox) but didn&#x2019;t sweat the small stuff (whooping cough and chicken pox). My daughter had more visits to the doctor before she was in preschool than I&#x2019;ve had in my entire lifetime.</p><p>So, despite my dirty childhood filled with organic, homegrown food, protective parasites, lots of time outdoors, and limited contact with an overzealous medical system, how did I end up in adulthood with not one but three manifestations of microbial discord: eczema, rosacea, and yeast overgrowth? It took a while. I managed to weather potent microbial disruptors like the antibiotics prescribed in college for acne and twenty years of birth control pills (we&#x2019;ll talk about this more in Chapter 5) with no ill effects. But as life got more complicated, unrelenting stress and the cookies, cakes, and candy I consumed to combat it were my ultimate undoing. A Western diet high in sugar and fat promotes growth of the wrong types of bacteria in your gut, and a lifestyle that leaves literally no time to go outside and smell the roses can be the straw that breaks the camel&#x2019;s back, particularly if you have additional risk factors, as I did, such as significant antibiotic use.</p><p>Disease Begins in Your Microbiome</p><p>My firsthand experience with how poor nutrition and stress can unmask the effects of a damaged microbiome and lead to a multitude of symptoms is representative of what most of the patients I see in my office have experienced: a decline in overall well-being characterized by seemingly unrelated conditions that appear out of nowhere, leaving them scratching their head and wondering what&#x2019;s going on.</p><p>Microbial disruptors are everywhere&#x2014;in the food we eat, the water we drink, the products we use, and the medications we take&#x2014;and the clinical manifestations of a disrupted microbiome are varied and show up in people of all ages and stages. Chances are there&#x2019;s someone in your family with asthma, allergies, eczema, thyroiditis, diabetes, arthritis, or any of the many disorders that we&#x2019;re now discovering have the same root cause. A damaged microbiome isn&#x2019;t the only reason people develop these conditions, but it&#x2019;s often a major contributor that interacts with genetic and environmental factors to create a perfect storm of disease. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s more important than ever to understand the complex and critical role bacteria play in our health, so that if and when yours is compromised, you can connect the dots and start to heal yourself.</p><p>The solutions you&#x2019;ll find in this book are based on clinical trials in our own patient population at the Digestive Center for Women, data from other scientific studies, published papers, trial and error, anecdote, patient testimonials about what&#x2019;s worked for them, and careful observations accrued over almost two decades of taking care of people with all kinds of bacterial imbalance&#x2014;from serious autoimmune illnesses such as Crohn&#x2019;s disease and ulcerative colitis to complaints of gas and bloating. They&#x2019;re also based on my own journey of exploration and healing necessitated by my health challenges.</p><p>The new paradigm of bacteria as friend rather than foe is at the heart of a revolution in health care that&#x2019;s forcing us to reexamine how we live, as well as our medical practices, with new microscopic eyes, and to consider how modern life and our everyday choices affect the life of our microbes&#x2014;and how our microbes in turn affect us. What has become very clear is that our individual and collective health depends on it. My sincere hope is that this book will provide you with the microbiome solution that will help you reclaim your health and vitality and set you on the path to a dirtier and disease-free life.</p><p>See you on the farm!</p><p></p><p></p><p>part 1</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||</p><p>OUR MICROBES ARE intimately involved in every aspect of our health&#x2014;from ensuring our digestive well-being to influencing our likelihood of being obese and our risk of developing cancer or diabetes. They even play a role in our brain chemistry and mental health, affecting our moods, our emotions, and our personalities. We are, it seems, single individuals comprised of multiple living, breathing, moving parts. The more we learn about this fascinating microscopic community, the clearer it becomes that our fate is inextricably tied to theirs, making it essential that we learn more about where our microbes come from, what they do, and why we literally can&#x2019;t live without them.</p><p>Meet Your Microbiome</p><p>The microbiome refers to all of the organisms that live in or on your body: all of the bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and helminths (worms, for those of us who have them), as well as all of their genes. A staggering hundred trillion microbes that include thousands of different species inhabit your nooks and crannies&#x2014;with more than a billion bacteria in <i>just one drop</i> of fluid in your colon alone.</p><p>Your unique microbial footprint develops over your lifetime, and it reflects everything about you: your parents&#x2019; health, how and where you were born, what you&#x2019;ve eaten (including whether your first sips were breast milk or formula), where you&#x2019;ve lived, your occupation, personal hygiene, past infections, exposure to chemicals and toxins, medications, hormone levels, and even your emotions (stress can have a profound effect on the microbiome). The end result is a microbial mix so distinctive from person to person that yours is a more accurate identifier of you than your own DNA.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve known about the microbiome since the 1600s, when Antoni van Leeuwenhoek first looked at his own dental plaque under the microscope and described &#x201c;little living animalcules, very prettily a-moving.&#x201d; But it&#x2019;s taken us a few centuries to figure out that these fellow travelers might actually be helping rather than hindering us, with a specific purpose that&#x2019;s very much aligned with our own survival. The overwhelming majority of our microbes aren&#x2019;t germs that cause disease. Quite the contrary&#x2014;they&#x2019;re an essential part of our ecosystem and play a vital role in keeping us healthy.</p><p>How do we get from germ-free fetus to living, breathing petri dish, colonized with trillions of bacteria? Let&#x2019;s start at the cradle and work our way toward the grave, to find out exactly how our microbiome evolves and the crucial role it plays at every stage in our development.</p><p>Pregnancy</p><p>Long before we enter the world, our mother&#x2019;s microbiome starts to prepare for our arrival. One of the most dramatic changes happens in her vagina. During pregnancy, cells in the vaginal lining ramp up production of a carbohydrate called glycogen, sending glycogen-loving <i>Lactobacillus</i> bacteria into a feeding frenzy and increasing their numbers. <i>Lactobacilli</i> convert lactose and other sugars to lactic acid, creating an acidic, unfriendly environment that helps to protect the growing fetus from potential invaders.</p><p>Bacteria don&#x2019;t just protect us from undesirable germs that can enter via the vagina; they also nurture us. In the third trimester of pregnancy, <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Actinobacteria </i>species increase in number and cause a corresponding rise in the mother&#x2019;s blood sugar and weight gain in her breasts, with the specific goal of ensuring adequate growth and breast milk for the baby.

Now, with <b>The Wonder Spot</b>, Bank is back with her signature combination of devilishly self-deprecating humor, seriousness and wisdom.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing comes easily to Sophie Applebaum, the black sheep of her family trying to blend in with the herd. Uneasily situated between two brothers, Sophie first appears as the fulcrum and observer of her clan in "Boss of the World." Then, at college, in "The Toy Bar," she faces a gauntlet of challenges as Best Friend to the dramatic and beautiful Venice Lambourne, curator of "perfect things." In her early twenties, Sophie is dazzled by the possibilities of New York City during the Selectric typewriter era&#x2014;only to land solidly back in Surrey, PA after her father's death.</p><p><b>The Wonder Spot</b> follows Sophie's quest for her own identity&#x2014;who she is, what she loves, whom she loves, and occasionally whom she feels others should love&#x2014;over the course of 25 years. In an often-disappointing world, Sophie listens closely to her own heart. And when she experiences her 'Aha!' moments&#x2014;her own personal wonder spots&#x2014;it's the real thing. In this tremendous follow-up to <b>The Girls' Guide To Hunting And Fishing</b>, Bank again shares her vast talent for capturing a moment, taking it to heart, and giving it back to her readers.</p></p><p>Six years after her amazingly successful debut, <i>The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing</i>, Melissa Bank rewards her fans for their patience with <i>The Wonder Spot</i>, a refreshingly honest interpretation of one young woman's journey into adulthood. As we follow heroine Sophie Applebaum through a comfortable, yet awkward childhood in suburban Pennsylvania to the challenges of finding love and a career in midtown Manhattan, <i>The Wonder Spot</i> is never guilty of the self-indulgent traps set by other members of the Chick Lit genre Bank helped launch.<p> </p><p> </p><p> We first meet the Applebaum clan on their way to cousin Rebecca's bat mitzvah in Chappaqua, New York, where Sophie ends up sneaking cigarettes in the woods with a handsome eighth grader one year her senior. Yet even this minor rebellion is more charming than anything else; as with most of her future transgressions, Sophie is less the instigator than the innocent witness. Defining moments in Sophie's life are revealed through her relationships: an almost mythical college roommate named Venice; her charismatic yet capricious older brother; her brilliant younger brother; her unpenetrable father; and her hilarious grandmother, who takes it upon herself to save her "Sophila" from "impending spinsterhood." Of course no real journey into young womanhood is complete without a series of committment phobic, potentially deliquent, overly nice men whose appearances seem less about love than about demonstrating our heroine's inability to ever truly be comfortable with herself. As Sophie observes during a seventh grade skating party, "I felt sure that everyone was looking at me and then realized that no one was, and i experienced the distinct shame of each."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Undeniably clever, occasionally hilarious, and often poignant, <i>The Wonder Spot</i> is captivating enough for readers to forgive Sophie's indecisive, self-destructive tendancies and simply bask in her sincerity. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td> <b>Wonder Woman: An Amazon.com Interview with Melissa Bank</b><b> </b></td> </tr> </tbody></table><p> </p><p> Melissa Bank's bestselling 1999 debut, <i>The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing</i>, took readers by storm and heralded the wave of Chick Lit to follow in its wake.

He writes of bureaucrats, students and Cultural Revolution survivors, stripping none of their complexity and humanity. He&#39;s gentle with their idiocies, saving his sharpest barbs for himself (it&#39;s his pants that split from zipper to waist whilst demonstrating martial arts in Canton). Though dribs of history and drabs of classical lore seep through, this is mostly a personal tale, noted by the Los Angeles Times for &#34;the charmingly unpretentious manner in which it penetrates a China inaccessible to other foreigners.&#34;"Salzman demonstrates with skill and subtlety just how Chinese society works."--The Washington Post<p>"Gong fu, or 'skill that transcends mere surface beauty'...no other term is as apt for a book that describes China and its people with such deftness and delight."--Time</p></p><h2>Acts (Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, NT Volume 5)</h2><p>Editor Francis Martin collects patristic comment on the text of Acts in this volume of the ACCS. The Acts of the Apostles--or more in keeping with the author's intent, the Acts of the Ascended Lord--is part two of Luke's story of "all that Jesus began to do and teach." In it he recounts the expansion of the church as its witness spread from Jerusalem to all of Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth. While at least forty early church authors commented on Acts, the works of only three survive in their entirety--John Chrysostom's <em>Homilies on the Acts of the Apostles,</em> Bede the Venerable's <em>Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles</em> and a long Latin epic poem by Arator. In this volume, substantial selections from the first two of these appear with occasional excerpts from Arator alongside many excerpts from the fragments preserved in J. A. Cramer's <em>Catena in Acta SS. Apostolorum.</em> Among the latter we find selections from Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, Ephrem the Syrian, Didymus the Blind, Athanasius, Jerome, John Cassian, Augustine, Ambrose, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Theodoret of Cyr, Origen, Cyril of Jerusalem, Cyril of Alexandria, Cassiodorus and Hilary of Poitiers, some of which are here translated into English for the first time. As readers, we find these early authors transmit life to us because their faith brought them into living and experiential contact with the realities spoken of in the Sacred Text.</p><p><strong>Francis Martin</strong> is a priest of the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., and professor of biblical studies at the John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family.

Green, American Reference Books Annual, 2006, Volume 37)<br><br>"Contemporary Christians would do well to draw the hermeneutical circle broadly enough to include not only cross-cultural voices from around the world but also the voices to be found in the Ancient Christian Commentary series. This is an excellent sermon-preparation resource for pastors." (Christian Century, May 2, 2006)<br><br>"All who are interested in the interpretation of the Bible will welcome the forthcoming multivolume series Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture. Here the insights of scores of early church fathers will be assembled and made readily available for significant passages throughout the Bible and the Apocrypha. It is hard to think of a more worthy ecumenical project to be undertaken by InterVarsity Press." (Bruce M. Metzger, professor emeritus of New Testament, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"For those who think that church history began around 1941, when their pastor was born, this commentary will be a great surprise. Christians throughout the centuries have read the biblical text and nursed their spirits with it and then applied it to their lives. These commentaries reflect that the witness of the Holy Spirit was present in his church throughout the centuries. As a result, we can profit by allowing the ancient Christians to speak to us today." (Haddon Robinson, Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Professor of Preaching, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)<br><br>"There is no shortage of new books on the market and it may be a surprise to some to see IVP producing the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture series. But, bearing in mind C. S. Lewis's admonition, 'It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between,' this series will fill a great need that many of us may not even be aware of--the need to read those who have gone before us." (D. Stuart Briscoe)<br><br>"We speak abstractly in scholarly circles of the need to transcend looking at Christianity through the spectrum of modern presuppositions. This series, based on the commentaries of early Christians, gives us a concrete way to do this. It's a great idea." (Don S. Browning, Alexander Campbell Professor of Ethics and Social Sciences, The Divinity School, University of Chicago)<br><br>"The Scriptures have been read with love and attention for nearly two thousand years, and listening to the voice of believers from previous centuries opens us to unexpected insight and deepened faith. Those who studied Scripture in the centuries closest to its writing, the centuries during and following persecution and martyrdom, speak with particular authority. The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture will bring to life the truth that we are invisibly surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses." (Frederica Mathewes-Green, commentator, National Public Radio)<br><br>"Composed in the style of the great medieval <em>catenae,</em> this new anthology of patristic commentary on Holy Scripture, conveniently arranged by chapter and verse, will be a valuable resource for prayer, study and proclamation. By calling attention to the rich Christian heritage preceding the separations between East and West and between Protestant and Catholic, this series will perform a major service to the cause of ecumenism."

Bergquist identified four different, yet interrelated, cultures found in North American higher education: collegial, managerial, developmental, and advocacy. In this new and expanded edition of that classic work, Bergquist and coauthor Kenneth Pawlak propose that there are additional external influences in our global culture that are pressing upon the academic institution, forcing it to alter the way it goes about its business. Two new cultures are now emerging in the academic institution as a result of these global, external forces: the virtual culture, prompted by the technological and social forces that have emerged over the past twenty years, and the tangible culture, which values its roots, community, and physical location and has only recently been evident as a separate culture partly in response to emergence of the virtual culture. These two cultures interact with the previous four, creating new dynamics.</p><p><p><b>Engaging the Six Cultures of the Academy</b> </p><p>In <i>The Four Cultures of the Academy</i>, William H.

These two cultures interact with the previous four, creating new dynamics. </p><p>Bergquist and Pawlak look at culture's impact on postsecondary education, where it plays a major role in defining patterns of perceiving, thinking, and feeling about the nature and scope of education. The authors propose that each of the six key cultures operating within higher educational institutions has much to say about educational mission, vision, values, and purposes and about roles to be played by instructors, students, administrators, trustees, and even the general public. They offer a framework that can guide leaders and inspire new courses of action for the further improvement of functioning within these complicated institutions. Specifically, they describe ways in which to use (or not use) the concepts of organizational culture so that those who work in academic institutions can improve their daily lives as leaders, administrators, faculty members, trustees, and concerned stakeholders. </p><p>In the case of each culture, they examine its distinctive history, perspectives, and values, and offer specific suggestions concerning ways to engage the six cultures </p><p>so that each culture can contribute to the learning of educators&#x2014;rather than reinforcing limiting and inflexible assumptions about the nature and direction of the higher education enterprise.</p><p><b>THE AUTHORS</b> </p><p><b>William H.

To write this book, she spent three years traveling to hot spots in Africa, Europe, Asia, and the United States investigating the dynamics of illegal trade around the world&#x2015;from blood diamonds and arms to pharmaceuticals, exotica, and staples like food and oil. <i>Global Outlaws </i>peels away the layers of a vast economy that extends from a war orphan in Angola selling Marlboros on the street to powerful transnational networks reaching across continents and oceans. Nordstrom's extraordinary fieldwork includes interviews with scores of informants, including the smugglers, victims, power elite, and profiteers who populate these economic war zones. Her compelling investigation, showing that the sum total of extra-legal activities represents a significant part of the world's economy, provides a new framework for understanding twenty-first-century economics and economic power. <i>Global Outlaws </i>powerfully reveals the illusions and realities of security in all areas of transport and trade and illuminates many of the difficult ethical problems these extra-legal activities pose.</p><p>"A deeply insightful book that connects the dots of the hidden systems that have subverted democracy and caused the type of desperation and anger that result in a 9/11. A book that opens our awareness."&#x2015;John Perkins, author of The New York Times bestseller <i>Confessions Of An Economic Hit Man</i><br><br>"Anyone interested in global economic crime should read this book."&#x2015;Charmian Gooch, a founding director of Global Witness<br><br>"<i>Global Outlaws</i> is a revealing book about a global trend whose importance is still far from being fully recognized."&#x2015;Moises Naim, Editor in Chief of <i>Foreign Policy Magazine</i> and author of <i>Illicit: How Smugglers Traffickers and Copycats are Hijacking the Global Economy</i><br><br>"Carolyn Nordstrom's important new book takes us on a dark journey through war-torn landscapes riddled with corruption, violence, and gross inequalities. It is a compelling study&#x2015;one guided by the norms of scholarly research but also written out of deeply felt experience. A book infused by anger, compassion, but also hope."&#x2015;Andrew Mack, University of British Columbia<br><br>"This is a fascinating, insightful, and important ethnographic study of the intersection of crime, finance, and power in the illegal, 'informal', or underground economy. I have read all of Carolyn Nordstrom's books, and this is the best one yet."&#x2015;Jeff Sluka, Massey University<br><br>"Carolyn Nordstrom's <i>Global Outlaws</i> is a rare and remarkable fusion of economic anthropology and travel writing.

Chapters 3 12 present seventy six readings that are organized in the conventional way into ten topical areas: abortion; drugs and autonomy (new to this edition); euthanasia and assisted suicide; genetic engineering and cloning; the death penalty; war, terrorism, and torture; pornography; economic justice and health care; animal rights and environmental duties; and global obligations to the poor.<br><br><strong>Offering a special feature not found in other anthologies, the selections are also organized in an unconventional way, by argument, so that students can more easily see how philosophers have debated each other on these critical issues.</strong> Each argument opens with an introduction that outlines the argument's key points, provides context for it, and reviews some of the main responses to it. Each introduction is followed by two to four essays that present the argument's classic statement, critiques and defenses of it, and related debates.<br><br><em>Contemporary Moral Arguments</em> incorporates more pedagogical features than any other reader, including:<br><br>* <strong>Essay questions</strong> ideal for writing assignments after each of the twenty seven argument sections<br><br>* <strong>Four types of boxes throughout: Facts and Figures, Public Opinion, Legalities, and Time Lines</strong><br><br>* A list of <strong>key terms</strong> at the end of each chapter, all defined in the <strong>glossary,</strong> and <strong>suggestions for further reading</strong><br><br>* <strong>An Instructor's Manual and Testbank on CD</strong> featuring chapter and reading summaries, lecture outlines in PowerPoint format, and essay and objective questions with an answer key<br><br>* <strong>A Companion Website at www.oup.com/us/vaughn</strong> containing the same material as the Instructor's Manual along with such student resources as self quizzes and flash cards<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Lewis Vaughn</strong> is the author or coauthor of several books, including <em>Philosophy Here and Now</em> (2012), <em>Bioethics,</em> Second Edition (2012), <em>The Power of Critical Thinking,</em> Fourth Edition (2012), and <em>Great Philosophical Arguments</em> (2011), all published by Oxford University Press.<br><br>"One of the book's major strengths is the way that it divides the general topics into specific key debates.

Thompson, Edgewood College, Madison, Wisconsin, and Gene Stanford, Children&#39;s Hospital, Buffalo, New York. With a Foreword by Jerriann Myers Wilson. Child life services include providing emotional support, structuring therapeutic play programs, psychologically preparing children for medical procedures, enhancing the hospital environment, and acting as the child&#39;s and parents&#39; advocate. This book covers them all. It begins by describing the provision of these services in a typical case and by reviewing the relevant literature. The authors then discuss parents&#39; needs and parent involvement, the hospital play program, and ways in which the hospital environment contributes to children&#39;s reactions. Equally thorough information is presented on the relationship of child life to other disciplines; supervision of volunteers, students and staff; and the development of a child life program. The text&#39;s balance of tools, techniques and guidelines makes it valuable not only to child life specialists, but also to nurses, occupational and recreational therapists, social workers, and other hospital personnel.</p><p></p><h2>Entrepreneurship: Successfully Launching New Ventures</h2><p><p> <b>NOTE:&nbsp;</b>This edition features the same content as the traditional text in a convenient, three-hole-punched, loose-leaf version.

Blizzard. In COME LOOK WITH ME: ANIMALS IN ART, she makes the most of children&#39;s natural curiosity about animals to introduce them not only to twelve magnificent works of art, but also to a whole new way of encountering art. Using an approach which is as fun as it is effective, the author deftly guides her young audience toward their own understanding of and delight in the world of art. The works featured in ANIMALS IN ART represent a variety of styles which students will encounter again in museums and in books: the muscular realism of Rosa Bonheur&#39;s &#34;The Horse Fair&#34;, the delicate romanticism of Martin Johnson Heade&#39;s &#34;Cattleya Orchid&#34; and &#34;Three Brazilian Hummingbirds,&#34; the bold abstraction of Henri Matisse&#39;s &#34;The Snail.&#34; They also represent an intriguing menagerie of beasts, from the mysterious deer and horses stampeding across the wall of Lascaux cave to Paul Klee&#39;s whimsical heart-nosed cat dreaming of a bird.</p><p>The &#34;Come Look with Me&#34; series was created by Gladys S. Blizzard, whose experiences as an art teacher and work as a curator of education at Bayly Art Museum at the University of Virginia served as the basis for this educational style.The theory that interest in fine art can be kindled by actively engaging children in discussion shapes this series, now on its third volume. From a Lascaux cave painting to a Rauschenberg collage, 12 chronologically ordered paintings are paired with questions that guide viewers in pondering an artist's intentions or identifying elements of form, line, composition, color, etc. For example, "Would you be afraid to walk among these animals? Why or why not?" accompanies Edward Hicks's The Peaceable Kingdom . Often dull exercises in tallying similar objects, her questions are sometimes rhetorical, as in the suggested resemblance between Paul Klee's Cat and Bird and a mask, and seem ill-suited to the suggested age range. Supplementary texts--covering biographical details, iconography and, occasionally, style--seem to be aimed at adults rather than children. Unlike the exhibit mounted in I Spy (see above), Blizzard's selection of paintings is insufficiently varied, and her book never rises above the dutiful.

Inside is the full text of the original novel, with decorations by Mary GrandPr�.<br></i><br>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the pivotal fourth novel in the seven-part tale of Harry Potter&#x2019;s training as a wizard and his coming of age. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the International Quidditch Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He wants to dream about Cho Chang, his crush (and maybe do more than dream). He wants to find out about the mysterious event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn&#x2019;t happened for a hundred years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, he&#x2019;s not normal &#x2014; even by wizarding standards.<br><br>And in this case, different can be deadly.<br><br></p><p>In <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.<p> Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? </p><p> But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a "nice deserted moor." As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes "squealing the names of the players" as well as "tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves." Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: "The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field."</p><p> Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This <i>Daily Prophet</i> scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.)

His theories, many of which are illustrated in this astonishing &#39;inventory of effects&#39;, force us to question how modes of communication have shaped society. This is an astonishing work by a truly astonishing man. &#34;The Penguin on Design&#34; series includes the works of creative thinkers whose writings on art, design and the media have changed our vision forever. This is one of four books in that series.</p><p><i>The Medium is the Massage</i> is Marshall McLuhan's most condensed, and perhaps most effective, presentation of his ideas. Using a layout style that was later copied by <i>Wired</i>, McLuhan and coauthor/designer Quentin Fiore combine word and image to illustrate and enact the ideas that were first put forward in the dense and poorly organized <i>Understanding Media</i>. McLuhan's ideas about the nature of media, the increasing speed of communication, and the technological basis for our understanding of who we are come to life in this slender volume. Although originally printed in 1967, the art and style in <i>The Medium is the Massage</i> seem as fresh today as in the summer of love, and the ideas are even more resonant now that computer interfaces are becoming gateways to the global village.Marshall McLuhan was a Canadian educator, philosopher and scholar - a professor of English Literature, a literary critic and a communications theorist. McLuhan&#39;s work is viewed as one of the cornerstones of the study of media theory. McLuhan is known for coining the expressions &#39;the medium is the message&#39; and the &#39;global village&#39;.</p><h2>Cute &amp; Easy Crochet with Flowers: 35 beautiful projects using floral motifs</h2><p>Make 35 gorgeous crochet projects all incorporating beautiful floral motifs and decorations.<br><br>Nicki Trench returns with another set of cute and easy crochet projects for your home, family, and friends, all in a pretty pastel color palette and adorned with crocheted flowers.

He lives with his wife, Judine, in the Pacific Northwest.1<br>The sun was already sinking into the deep green of the hills to the west of the valley, the red and gray-pink of its shadows touching the corners of the land, when Flick Ohmsford began his descent.1 The trail stretched out unevenly down the northern slope, winding through the huge boulders which studded the rugged terrain in massive clumps, disappearing into the thick forests of the lowlands to reappear in brief glimpses in small clearings and thinning spaces of woodland. Flick followed the familiar trail with his eyes as he trudged wearily along, his light pack slung loosely over one shoulder. His broad, windburned face bore a set, placid look, and only the wide gray eyes revealed the restless energy that burned beneath the calm exterior. He was a young man, though his stocky build and the grizzled brown hair and shaggy eyebrows made him look much older. He wore the loose-fitting work clothes of the Vale people and in the pack he carried were several metal implements that rolled and clanked loosely against one another.<br><br>There was a slight chill in the evening air, and Flick clutched the collar of his open wool shirt closer to his neck. His journey ahead lay through forests and rolling flatlands, the latter not yet visible to him as he passed into the forests, and the darkness of the tall oaks and somber hickories reached upward to overlap and blot out the cloudless night sky. The sun had set, leaving only the deep blue of the heavens pinpointed by thousands of friendly stars. The huge trees shut out even these, and Flick was left alone in the silent darkness as he moved slowly along the beaten path. Because he had traveled this same route a hundred times, the young man noticed immediately the unusual stillness that seemed to have captivated the entire valley this evening. The familiar buzzing and chirping of insects normally present in the quiet of the night, the cries of the birds that awoke with the setting of the sun to fly in search of food&#x2014;all were missing. Flick listened intently for some sound of life, but his keen ears could detect nothing. He shook his head uneasily. The deep silence was unsettling, particularly in view of the rumors of a frightening black-winged creature sighted in the night skies north of the valley only days earlier.<br><br>He forced himself to whistle and turned his thoughts back to his day&#x2019;s work in the country just to the north of the Vale, where outlying families farmed and tended domestic livestock.2 He traveled to their homes every week, supplying various items that they required and bringing bits of news on the happenings of the Vale and occasionally the distant cities of the deep Southland. Few people knew the surrounding countryside as well as he did, and fewer still cared to travel beyond the comparative safety of their homes in the valley. Men were more inclined to remain in isolated communities these days and let the rest of the world get along as best it could. But Flick liked to travel outside the valley from time to time, and the outlying homesteads were in need of his services and were willing to pay him for the trouble.3 Flick&#x2019;s father was not one to let an opportunity pass him by where there was money to be made, and the arrangement seemed to work out well for all concerned.<br><br>A low-hanging branch brushing against his head caused Flick to start suddenly and leap to one side. In chagrin, he straightened himself and glared back at the leafy obstacle before continuing his journey at a slightly quicker pace. He was deep in the lowland forests now and only slivers of moonlight were able to find their way through the thick boughs overhead to light the winding path dimly. It was so dark that Flick was having trouble finding the trail, and as he studied the lay of the land ahead, he again found himself conscious of the heavy silence. It was as if all life had been suddenly extinguished, and he alone remained to find his way out of this forest tomb. Again he recalled the strange rumors. He felt a bit anxious in spite of himself and glanced worriedly around. But nothing stirred on the trail ahead nor moved in the trees about him, and he felt embarrassingly relieved.<br><br>Pausing momentarily in a moonlit clearing, he gazed at the fullness of the night sky before passing abruptly into the trees beyond. He walked slowly, picking his way along the winding path that had narrowed beyond the clearing and now seemed to disappear into a wall of trees and bushes ahead. He knew that it was merely an illusion, but found himself glancing about uneasily all the same. A few moments later, he was again on a wider trail and could discern bits of sky peeking through the heavy trees. He was almost to the bottom of the valley and about two miles from his home. He smiled and began whistling an old tavern song as he hurried on. He was so intent on the trail ahead and the open land beyond the forest that he failed to notice the huge black shadow that seemed to rise up suddenly, detaching itself from a great oak tree on his left and moving swiftly toward the path to intercept him. The dark figure was almost on top of the Valeman before Flick sensed its presence looming up before him like a great, black stone which threatened to crush his smaller being. With a startled cry of fear he leaped aside, his pack falling to the path with a crash of metal, and his left hand whipped out the long thin dagger at his waist. Even as he crouched to defend himself, he was stayed by a commanding arm raised above the figure before him and a strong, yet reassuring voice that spoke out quickly.<br><br>&#x201c;Wait a moment, friend. I&#x2019;m no enemy and have no wish to harm you. I merely seek directions and would be grateful if you could show me the proper path.&#x201d;<br><br>Flick relaxed his guard a bit and tried to peer into the blackness of the figure before him in an effort to discover some semblance of a human being. He could see nothing, however, and he moved to the left with cautious steps in an attempt to catch the features of the dark figure in the tree-shadowed moonlight.<br><br>&#x201c;I assure you, I mean no harm,&#x201d; the voice continued, as if reading the Valeman&#x2019;s mind. &#x201c;I did not mean to frighten you, but I didn&#x2019;t see you until you were almost upon me, and I was afraid you might pass me by without realizing I was there.&#x201d;<br><br>The voice stopped and the huge black figure stood silently, though Flick could feel the eyes following him as he edged about the path to put his own back to the light. Slowly the pale moonlight began to etch out the stranger&#x2019;s features in vague lines and blue shadows. For a long moment the two faced each other in silence, each studying the other, Flick in an effort to decide what it was he faced, the stranger in quiet anticipation.<br><br>Then suddenly the huge figure lunged with terrible swiftness, his powerful hands seizing the Valeman&#x2019;s wrists, and Flick was lifted abruptly off the solid earth and held high, his knife dropping from nerveless fingers as the deep voice laughed mockingly up at him.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, well, my young friend! What are you going to do now, I wonder? I could cut your heart out on the spot and leave you for the wolves if I chose, couldn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br><br>Flick struggled violently to free himself, terror numbing his mind to any thought but that of escape. He had no idea what manner of creature had subdued him, but it was far more powerful than any normal man and apparently prepared to dispatch Flick quickly. Then abruptly, his captor held him out at arm&#x2019;s length, and the mocking voice became icy cold with displeasure.<br><br>&#x201c;Enough of this, boy! We have played our little game and still you know nothing of me. I&#x2019;m tired and hungry and have no wish to be delayed on the forest trail in the chill of the evening while you decide if I am man or beast. I will set you down that you may show me the path. I warn you&#x2014;do not try to run from me or it will be the worse for you.&#x201d;<br><br>The strong voice trailed off and the tone of displeasure disappeared as the former hint of mockery returned with a short laugh.<br><br>&#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; the figure rumbled as the fingers released their iron grip and Flick slipped to the path, &#x201c;I may be a better friend than you realize.&#x201d;4<br><br>The figure moved back a step as Flick straightened himself, rubbing his wrists carefully to restore the circulation to his numbed hands. He wanted to run, but was certain that the stranger would catch him again and this time finish him without further thought. He leaned over cautiously and picked up the fallen dagger, returning it to his belt.<br><br>Flick could see the fellow more clearly now, and a quick scrutiny of him revealed that he was definitely human, though much larger than any man Flick had ever seen. He was at least seven feet tall, but exceptionally lean, though it was difficult to be certain about this, since his tall frame was wrapped in a flowing black cloak with a loose cowl pulled close about his head. The darkened face was long and deeply lined, giving it a craggy appearance. The eyes were deep-set and almost completely hidden from view by shaggy eyebrows that knotted fiercely over a long flat nose. A short, black beard outlined a wide mouth that was just a line on the face&#x2014;a line that never seemed to move. The overall appearance was frightening, all blackness and size, and Flick had to fight down the urge building within him to make a break for the forest&#x2019;s edge. He looked straight into the deep, hard eyes of the stranger, though not without some difficulty, and managed a weak smile.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you were a thief,&#x201d; he mumbled hesitantly.<br><br>&#x201c;You were mistaken,&#x201d; was the quiet retort. Then the voice softened a bit. &#x201c;You must learn to know a friend from an enemy. Sometime your life may depend upon it. Now then, let&#x2019;s have your name.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Flick Ohmsford.&#x201d;<br><br>Flick hesitated and then continued in a slightly braver tone of voice.<br><br>&#x201c;My father is Curzad Ohmsford. He manages an inn in Shady Vale a mile or two from here. You could find lodging and food there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, Shady Vale,&#x201d; the stranger exclaimed suddenly. &#x201c;Yes, that is where I am going.&#x201d; He paused as if reflecting on his own words. Flick watched him cautiously as he rubbed his craggy face with crooked fingers and looked beyond the forest&#x2019;s edge to the rolling grasslands of the valley. He was still looking away when he spoke again.<br><br>&#x201c;You . . . have a brother.&#x201d;<br><br>It was not a question; it was a simple statement of fact. It was spoken so distantly and calmly, as if the tall stranger were not at all interested in any sort of a reply, that Flick almost missed hearing it. Then suddenly realizing the significance of the remark, he started and looked quickly at the other.<br><br>&#x201c;How did . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, well,&#x201d; the man said, &#x201c;doesn&#x2019;t every young Valeman like yourself have a brother somewhere?&#x201d;<br><br>Flick nodded dumbly, unable to comprehend what it was that the other was trying to say and wondering vaguely how much he knew about Shady Vale. The stranger was looking questioningly at him, evidently waiting to be guided to the promised food and lodging. Flick quickly turned away to find his hastily discarded pack, picked it up and slung it over his shoulder, looking back at the figure towering over him.<br><br>&#x201c;The path is this way.&#x201d; He pointed, and the two began walking.<br><br>They passed out of the deep forest and entered rolling, gentle hills which they would follow to the hamlet of Shady Vale at the far end of the valley. Out of the woods, it was a bright night; the moon was a full white globe overhead, its glow clearly illuminating the landscape of the valley and the path which the two travelers were following. The path itself was a vague line winding over the grassy hills and distinguishable only by occasional rain-washed ruts and flat, hard patches of earth breaking through the heavy grass. The wind had gathered strength and rushed at the two men with quick gusts that whipped at their clothing as they walked, forcing them to bow their heads slightly to shield their eyes. Neither spoke a word as they proceeded, each concentrating on the lay of the land beyond, as new hills and small depressions appeared with the passing of each traveled knoll. Except for the rushing of the wind, the night remained silent. Flick listened intently, and once he thought he heard a sharp cry far to the north, but an instant later it was gone, and he did not hear it again. The stranger appeared to be unconcerned with the silence. His attention seemed to be focused on a constantly changing point on the ground some six feet in front of them. He did not look up and he did not look at his young guide for directions as they went. Instead, he seemed to know exactly where the other was going and walked confidently beside him.<br><br>After a while, Flick began to have trouble keeping pace with the tall man, who traveled the path with long, swinging strides that dwarfed Flick&#x2019;s shorter ones. At times, the Valeman almost had to run to keep up. Once or twice the other man glanced down at his smaller companion and, seeing the difficulty he was having in trying to match strides, slowed to an easier pace. Finally, as the southern slopes of the valley drew near, the hills began to level off into shrub-covered grasslands that hinted at the appearance of new forests. The terrain began to dip downward at a gentle slope, and Flick located several familiar landmarks that bounded the outskirts of Shady Vale. He felt a surge of relief in spite of himself. The hamlet and his own warm home were just ahead.<br><br>The stranger did not speak a single word during the brief journey, and Flick was reluctant to attempt any conversation. Instead, he tried to study the giant in quick glimpses as they walked, without permitting the other to observe what he was doing. He was understandably awed. The long, craggy face, shaded by the sharp black beard, recalled the fearful Warlocks described to him by stern elders before the glowing embers of a late-evening fire when he was only a child. Most frightening were the stranger&#x2019;s eyes&#x2014;or rather the deep, dark caverns beneath the shaggy brows where his eyes should be. Flick could not penetrate the heavy shadows that continued to mask that entire area of his face. The deeply lined countenance seemed carved from stone, fixed and bowed slightly to the path before it. As Flick pondered the inscrutable visage, he suddenly realized that the stranger had never even mentioned his name.<br><br>The two were on the outer lip of the Vale, where the now clearly distinguishable path wound through large, crowded bushes that almost choked off human passage. The tall stranger stopped suddenly and stood perfectly still, head bowed, listening intently. Flick halted beside him and waited quietly, also listening, but unable to detect anything. They remained motionless for seemingly endless minutes, and then the big man turned hurriedly to his smaller companion.<br><br>&#x201c;Quickly! Hide in the bushes ahead. Go now, run!&#x201d;<br><br>He half pushed, half threw Flick in front of him as he raced swiftly toward the tall brush. Flick scurried fearfully for the sanctuary of the shrubbery, his pack slapping wildly against his back and the metal implements clanging. The stranger turned on him and snatched the pack away, tucking it beneath the long robe.<br><br>&#x201c;Silence!&#x201d; he hissed. &#x201c;Run now. Not a sound.&#x201d;<br><br>They ran quickly to the dark wall of foliage some fifty feet ahead, and the tall man hurriedly pushed Flick through the leafy branches that whipped against their faces, pulling him roughly into the middle of a large clump of brush, where they stood breathing heavily. Flick glanced at his companion and saw that he was not looking through the brush at the country around them, but instead was peering upward where the night sky was visible in small, irregular patches through the foliage. The sky seemed clear to the Valeman as he followed...</p><h2>Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery</h2><p>Every town in France has at least one charcutier, whose windows are dressed with astonishing displays of good food; pates, terrines, galantines, jambon, saucissions sec and boudins. The charcutier will also sell olives, anchovies, condiments as well as various salads of his own creation, making a visit the perfect stop to assemble picnics and impromptu meals. But the real skill of the charcutier lies in his transformation of the pig into an array of delicacies; a trade which goes back at least as far as classical Rome, when Gaul was famed for its hams. <br><br>First published in 1969 but unavailable for many years, Jane Grigson's Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery is a guidebook and a recipe book.

Clement of Alexandria indeed declared it the "spiritual Gospel." Early disputers with heretics such as Cerinthus and the Ebionites drew upon the Gospel of John to refute their heretical notions and uphold the full deity of Christ. This Gospel more than any other was central to the trinitarian and christological debates of the fourth and fifth centuries. At the same time, the Gospel of John was also thought to be the most chronological, and even to this day is the source of our sense of Jesus' having a three-year ministry. And John Chrysostom's <em>Homilies on John,</em>, perhaps more than any other commentary, emphasizes Christ's humanity and condescension toward the human race. In addition to the serial homilies of John Chrysostom, readers of this volume of the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture (ACCS) will find selections from those of Origen, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Cyril of Alexandria and Augustine. These commentaries are supplemented with homiletic material from Gregory the Great, Peter Chrysologus, Caesarius, Amphilochius, Basil the Great and Basil of Seleucia among others. Liturgical selections derive from Ephraim the Syrian, Ambrose and Romanos the Melodist, which are further supplemented with doctrinal material from Athanasius, the Cappodocians, Hilary and Ambrose. This rich tradition, some of which is here translated for the first time, offers a vast treasure out of which today's scribes trained for the kingdom may bring forth that which is new and what is old.

There isn&#39;t a Catholic alive who doesn&#39;t understand that one of the biggest obstacles to a Protestant&#39;s conversion to the Catholic faith is Mary and the ways in which Catholics use the Rosary to pray. So when a Protestant writes a book about the Rosary, it is often worth our time and effort. This is because the convert has investigated and researched and prayed, no doubt, for a better understanding about Mary&#39;s Rosary before making the commitment to convert. This naturally leads to a book that ought to be filled with insights that affected the author and can deepen a Catholic&#39;s understanding as well. Matt Swaim delivers--in a big way--in his book The Eucharist and the Rosary, published by Liguori. Swaim takes each of the 20 different mysteries and makes them personal and relevant--while keeping them reverent and mysterious. I was particularly affected by Swaim&#39;s pages on the Transfiguration; he writes with clarity and insight. The Eucharist and the Rosary is an excellent physical size to take to Adoration and the handful of reflection questions at the end of each mystery (which also tend to be the perfect length for reading at Adoration) make it a great guide for this time with Christ. --Cheryl Dickow, author of Our Jewish Roots</p><h2>The Valhalla Prophecy: A Novel (Nina Wilde and Eddie Chase)</h2><p>For fans of James Rollins and Matthew Reilly comes a heart-stopping, globe-spanning adventure in Andy McDermott&#x2019;s explosive series featuring American archaeologist Nina Wilde and ex-SAS bodyguard Eddie Chase.<br><br><b>MYSTERIOUS RUNESTONES.</b><br> <b>AN ANCIENT VIKING MYTH.</b><br> <b>AND A PROPHECY OF LIFE OR DEATH.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>In a Stockholm museum, thieves steal an enormous Norse runestone, but not before killing a security guard.

Lola had, until a few months earlier, been Nina&#x2019;s personal assistant at the International Heritage Agency. The reason for her departure was peering curiously at the world around him from a papoose on the chest of Lola&#x2019;s husband. &#x201c;Lola, Don, hi! Wow, it&#x2019;s so great to see you both again! And to meet this little guy in person for the first time. Oh, he&#x2019;s beautiful!&#x201d;<br><br>Nina&#x2019;s own husband also stood. &#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s not a bad-�looking sprog you&#x2019;ve got,&#x201d; said Eddie Chase with a grin. &#x201c;Shame about the name, though.&#x201d;<br><br>Lola pouted. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with Gino? It was my grandpa&#x2019;s name.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with it, it&#x2019;s just not as good as my suggestion. Now, Eddie&#x2014;�that&#x2019;s a name for a baby.&#x201d; He frowned. &#x201c;Wait, that didn&#x2019;t come out like I meant it to.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina laughed. &#x201c;Accurate, though.&#x201d; The balding Englishman pulled a face, to which Gino responded with a gurgling laugh of his own. &#x201c;Aw, look at that! He&#x2019;s so sweet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He is,&#x201d; said Lola, embracing the pair, &#x201c;when he&#x2019;s not occupying every moment of my time. And I thought you were demanding, Nina!&#x201d;<br><br>Now it was Nina&#x2019;s turn to look affronted, while Eddie chuckled. &#x201c;Come on, sit down,&#x201d; he said, pulling a chair out for the young mother. &#x201c;So being a parent&#x2019;s a bit stressful, is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have no idea, man,&#x201d; said Don as he unfastened the papoose. &#x201c;I thought being a firefighter was tough, but pulling people out of burning buildings is a cakewalk compared with watching out for a baby.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;s worse than I am,&#x201d; Lola said as she sat. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s danger everywhere, isn&#x2019;t there, hon? To him, every room looks like a death trap out of a Final Destination movie. It drives me nuts, &#x2019;cause now I can&#x2019;t even plug in my hair dryer without unlocking the gadgets he&#x2019;s put on all the outlets.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Safety&#x2019;s a serious business, babe,&#x201d; Don replied, in a way that suggested it was far from the first time he had been teased.<br><br>The big-�haired blonde took Gino from the papoose, settling the baby on her lap. &#x201c;Anyway, we&#x2019;re just about getting a handle on things, so we can finally catch up with everybody. What have I missed? What have you guys been up to? Have you found any more ancient wonders or saved the world again?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What, since the last time?&#x201d; asked Eddie with a mocking snort. &#x201c;Come on, it&#x2019;s only been a few months. Give us a chance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m enjoying the fact that we haven&#x2019;t been running around the world being chased and shot at and having everything blow up around us,&#x201d; Nina said, with considerable relief. &#x201c;It means I get to do the things I joined the IHA for in the first place. Like being an actual archaeologist, you know? Overseeing digs, research, writing papers . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie yawned theatrically. &#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s thrilling.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, shut up,&#x201d; said the redhead. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s amazing how much more productive you can be when you aren&#x2019;t being attacked by helicopter gunships and hunted by assassins.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And ninjas. Don&#x2019;t forget the ninjas.&#x201d;<br><br>Don&#x2019;s eyebrows rose. &#x201c;Babe? You are so not going back to the IHA.&#x201d;<br><br>Lola kissed Gino&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;This little guy&#x2019;s going to be my boss for the next few years, don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d; She looked back at Nina. &#x201c;If things are nice and easy at work, is that giving you more time to plan things at home?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What things?&#x201d; Nina asked.<br><br>&#x201c;You know.&#x201d; Lola held up Gino, who let out a little squeak of delight, and kissed him again. &#x201c;Family matters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; added Don. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been married for, what, two or three years now? I&#x2019;m surprised you don&#x2019;t have kids already.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina found herself feeling surprisingly defensive. &#x201c;My work hasn&#x2019;t been exactly conducive to it, what with all the . . . ninjas and world saving.&#x201d;<br><br>The burly firefighter nodded. &#x201c;But now everything&#x2019;s quieted down, you&#x2019;re thinking about it, yeah? I mean, you don&#x2019;t want to leave it too late.&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie huffed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not that old.&#x201d; He put on a crotchety old man&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hip to all the popular tunes of today&#x2019;s young people, you know.&#x201d; Lola laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re past forty, though, right? Me, I&#x2019;ve just gone thirty and Lola&#x2019;s coming up on it, and we were worried that might be pushing it&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Donnyyyyy,&#x201d; said Lola, singsong, through her teeth. Her husband got the message and clammed up. &#x201c;So, what&#x2019;s new at the IHA? How&#x2019;s my replacement working out?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Melinda?&#x201d; Nina said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine, she&#x2019;s doing a good job.&#x201d; Seeing Lola&#x2019;s face fall ever so slightly, she continued, &#x201c;Nearly as good as you.&#x201d; The younger woman brightened. &#x201c;Okay, what else? Al Little got a job with Apple in California, Lucy DeMille got engaged, Bill Schofield got promoted&#x2014;�oh, and we got a new UN liaison after Sebastian Penrose, uh, retired.&#x201d; The United Nations official&#x2019;s departure had been under a cloud, to say the least, but to avoid a media scandal the details were covered up. Nina had been dismayed at that, but the decision was made at far higher political levels than she had influence over. &#x201c;A guy called Oswald Seretse.&#x201d;<br><br>Lola searched her memory, then nodded. &#x201c;Oh&#x2014;�his dad&#x2019;s a diplomat too, isn&#x2019;t he? I met them at the UN once, before I transferred to the IHA.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I think so. Anyway, that&#x2019;s all the big stuff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You should come &#x2019;round to the office sometime,&#x201d; Eddie suggested. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot of people who&#x2019;d love to see you and your nipper.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe I will,&#x201d; said Lola. She looked down at her son. &#x201c;Would you like to see where Mommy worked before she had you? Would you, little snooky-�wooky?&#x201d; Gino did not appear enthused by the prospect.<br><br>&#x201c;Just make sure there aren&#x2019;t any frickin&#x2019; ninjas there that day,&#x201d; Don said.<br><br>&#x201c;There won&#x2019;t be,&#x201d; Eddie assured him. &#x201c;I shot &#x2019;em all.&#x201d; The firefighter&#x2019;s expression wavered between amusement and a suspicion that the Englishman was not joking.<br><br>&#x201c;Everyone would love to see you. And Gino,&#x201d; said Nina.<br><br>Lola smiled. &#x201c;Then we&#x2019;ll come.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good! In the meantime, I think it&#x2019;s time for some caffeine. What do you want?&#x201d;<br><br>Lola and Don named their choices, then Nina turned to Eddie, only to find him looking at Gino, lost in thought. &#x201c;Eddie?&#x201d;<br><br>He snapped back. &#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah. Just thinking about something, that&#x2019;s all. What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Coffee?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get &#x2019;em. What&#x2019;s everyone having?&#x201d;<br><br>Nina stood. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, I&#x2019;ll go. You want your usual?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, thanks.&#x201d;<br><br>She headed for the counter, looking back to find him again seeming preoccupied before returning to the conversation.<br><br>���<br><br>The same look was on his face that evening.<br><br>Nina was curled up in an armchair reading a book, ignoring the television. She raised her eyes to see her husband, stretched out on the sofa, paying just as little attention to the events on screen. &#x201c;Earth to Eddie.&#x201d;<br><br>He blinked and lifted his head. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You were miles away. Penny for your thoughts?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sounds like a good deal,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;d had a penny every time I&#x2019;d had a thought, I&#x2019;d probably have about . . . oh, three pounds seventeen by now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That much?&#x201d; They both smiled. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s on your mind? You had that same look this afternoon when we were with Lola and Don.&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie hesitated before replying. &#x201c;I was thinking about . . . well, what Don said. About having kids.&#x201d; He sat up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m wondering if he had a point. Do we want to have kids, and if we do, are we leaving it too late?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve still got plenty of time to decide,&#x201d; she assured him. &#x201c;Like you told him, we&#x2019;re not that old.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t seem convinced. &#x201c;I dunno. I&#x2019;m past forty now, you&#x2019;re coming up on thirty-�five . . . I mean, Christ, my mum and dad were only twenty-�one when they had me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Times change, though. People had kids when they were younger back then. My parents were in their mid-�twenties when I was born.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose.&#x201d;<br><br>Realizing that the matter was still bothering him, she put down her book and joined him on the sofa. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she said, putting her arms around him, &#x201c;do you want to have kids?&#x201d;<br><br>Another pause. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I really don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said, closing a hand around hers. &#x201c;I mean, it&#x2019;s not like we haven&#x2019;t talked about it before, and it&#x2019;s one of those things you just sort of assume&#x2019;ll happen after you get married. But . . . there&#x2019;ve been things that got in the way. Like mad cults and lost cities and psychos trying to start World War Three.&#x201d;<br><br>She grinned. &#x201c;Minor distractions, then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. Most people just worry about how it&#x2019;s going to affect their careers. We keep having the weight of the bloody world dumped on us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not really something you want to make a child deal with, is it? Probably a good thing we haven&#x2019;t had one after all.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina had meant the comment lightheartedly, but a sudden downcast twinge to his expression&#x2014;�which he hurriedly tried to hide&#x2014;�warned her that Eddie had taken it more seriously. &#x201c;Hey, hey,&#x201d; she said apologetically, &#x201c;I was joking. I&#x2019;m not ruling it out, not at all. But our lives have been, well . . . complicated.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I know.&#x201d; He intertwined his fingers with hers and squeezed her hand, then kissed her cheek. &#x201c;Although . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, things are a bit less complicated at the moment, aren&#x2019;t they? All the IHA&#x2019;s operations are ticking along without any trouble&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t jinx it!&#x201d;<br><br>He laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right, though, aren&#x2019;t I? The Atlantis dig&#x2019;s back up to speed after what happened last year; the Egyptians asked us to help with the tomb of Alexander the Great&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If that&#x2019;s what it really is,&#x201d; Nina cut in. Even the top experts in the field were not entirely certain whether the new excavations in Alexandria would bear fruit.<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever, we&#x2019;ve still got our hand in. And the Indian government&#x2019;s working with us on the Vault of Shiva, and even the Peruvians are letting the IHA get involved with what&#x2019;s happening at El Dorado.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Grudgingly,&#x201d; she said, with a flash of professional annoyance.<br><br>&#x201c;The point is, they&#x2019;ve still asked for our help. So we&#x2019;ve got all these digs going on at once, and you know what? They&#x2019;re all going smoothly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are so jinxing it!&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie grinned. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re going smoothly,&#x201d; he insisted, &#x201c;and you know why? Because you put people in charge of each of &#x2019;em who know what they&#x2019;re doing. So that means you don&#x2019;t have to micromanage everything anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>She treated him to a particularly sulky scowl. &#x201c;What do you mean, &#x2018;anymore&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, you never once looked over anyone&#x2019;s shoulder and told them to dig six inches to the left, did you?&#x201d; he said, kissing her again. &#x201c;But the IHA&#x2019;s in a quiet patch at the moment. We&#x2019;ve been talking about taking a break for a while&#x2014;�maybe now&#x2019;s the time. And there&#x2019;s the book thing too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right, the book thing,&#x201d; Nina echoed. It was her turn to become thoughtful. &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t know what I want to do about that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s to think about? For fuck&#x2019;s sake, love, they&#x2019;re offering you six figures to write about all the stuff you&#x2019;ve discovered! I know it&#x2019;s not like we desperately need the money or anything&#x201d;&#x2014;�he waved a hand to encompass their Upper East Side apartment&#x2014;�&#x201c;but you&#x2019;ve got to admit it&#x2019;d be a hell of a bonus. Christ, if you want I&#x2019;ll write everything up for you. Although I can&#x2019;t type, so I&#x2019;ll have to scribble it all down in biro.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just make sure you leave out all the things that are top secret,&#x201d; she reminded him, amused. &#x201c;Oh, and the part where you were wanted for murder by Interpol.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And the part where you got a faceful of crap while you were crawling through a sewer pipe.&#x201d;<br><br>She grimaced at the memory. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all glamour being a famous archaeologist, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie sniffed her cheek. &#x201c;You got most of it off. This book, though&#x2014;�it might be the perfect time to take a bit of a break and write it, while things are quiet at work. And we could also do some&#x201d;&#x2014;�a lascivious smirk crept across his square face&#x2014;�&#x201c;other stuff.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina feigned innocence. &#x201c;What kind of stuff, Mr. Chase?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you know. Shagging like rabbits.&#x201d;<br><br>She laughed, swatting his hand off hers. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s that subtle charm I fell in love with.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s irresistible, innit? I&#x2019;m serious, though, and not just about a nonstop fuck-�fest.&#x201d; Nina giggled. &#x201c;I mean about the book, and having a break from work. We could take a really long holiday, somewhere we haven&#x2019;t been before&#x2014;�and with absolutely nothing to do with archaeology.&#x201d;<br><br>Now she feigned horror. &#x201c;Oh, let&#x2019;s not do anything crazy . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Grant invited us out to Hollywood, remember? We could do that as part of a West Coast tour, maybe&#x2014;�start off in Seattle, then go down through San Francisco to LA to watch him filming his next movie. Even though it&#x2019;ll probably be as big a piece of crap as his last one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you liked action movies.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I like good action movies. Nitrous 2 was absolute bollocks, though.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think you mean Ni-�two-�rous,&#x201d; Nina corrected with a smile. Their movie-�star friend Grant Thorn&#x2019;s most recent film had gone by the rather awkward moniker of Ni2rous on its posters, providing a source of endless amusement to the couple&#x2014;�as well as late-�night talk show hosts.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, when nobody even knows how to pronounce the title, that&#x2019;s probably a bad start. It really was complete arse, though. That bit where he dived out of the car that went over the cliff and fired a grappling hook to grab hold of his mate&#x2019;s car that was jumping the other way? That was so fucking unrealistic they might as well have had him grow wings.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t any more unbelievable than his other movies, and you liked those.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I used to like &#x2019;em. Maybe I&#x2019;m growing old.&#x201d;<br><br>Her smile returned, wider. &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re growing up.&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie snorted. &#x201c;No danger of that, love. But I&#x2019;ve got to admit, these days I&#x2019;m happy just to watch Matt Damon moving purposefully for two hours. Still, actually getting to see Grant filming should be fun. Something to tell the grandkids.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That kinda presupposes kids,&#x201d; said Nina. &#x201c;I guess this conversation&#x2019;s come around full circle.&#x201d;<br><br>He shifted position to face her. &#x201c;So . . . what&#x2019;s your view on that? You&#x2019;re . . .&#x201d; He paused, choosing his words. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not dead set against it, are you?&#x201d;<br><br>She also gave careful consideration to her reply. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said at last. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not against it. It&#x2019;s just that, like I said, our lives have been complicated. But if things did get more straightforward, then . . .&#x201d; Another moment of thought. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t say no.&#x201d;<br><br>From the look of delight Eddie was trying hard to contain, it was clear he was happy with her answer. &#x201c;Nor would I.&#x201d;<br><br>They kissed, then held each other tight. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a big decision, though,&#x201d; Nina said at last.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, taking a sabbatical to get paid half a million dollars and have loads of sex. Big decision.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina prodded him in the stomach, making him flinch and laugh. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean like that. It&#x2019;s more about . . . well, what Don blurted out.&#x201d; She became more serious. &#x201c;We are getting on, in a purely biological sense.

They are works of great artistic purity and, despite all the nihilism, great generosity . . . the book is a major literary event.' A. Alvarez in the <i>Observer</i></p><p>Sylvia Plath churned out her final poems at the remarkable rate of two or three a day, and Robert Lowell describes them as written by "hardly a person at all ... but one of those super-real, hypnotic, great classical heroines." Even more remarkable, she wrote them during one of the coldest, snowiest winters (1962-63) Londoners have ever known. Snowbound, without central heating, she and her two children spent much of their time sniffling, coughing, or running temperatures (In "Fever 103�" she writes, "I have been flickering, off, on, off on. / The sheets grow heavy as a lecher's kiss."). Pipes froze, lights failed, and candles were unobtainable. <p> As if these physical privations weren't enough, Plath was out in the cold in another sense--her husband, Ted Hughes, had left her for another woman earlier that year. Despite all this (or perhaps <i>because</i> of it), the <i>Ariel</i> poems dazzle with their lyricism, their surprising and vivid imagery, and their wit. Rather than confining herself to her bleak surroundings, Plath draws from a wide array of experience. In "Berck-Plage," for instance, clouds are "electrifyingly-coloured sherbets, scooped from the freeze." In "The Night Dances," the poet stands crib-side, reveling in her son's own brand of do-si-do: "Such pure leaps and spirals--Surely they travel / The world forever, I shall not entirely / Sit emptied of beauties, the gift / Of your small breath..." </p><p> Though at times they present the reader with hopelessness laid bare, these poems also teem with the brightest shards of a life, confounding those who merely look for the words of a gloomy, dispassionate suicide. Plath rose each morning in the final months of her life to "that still blue, almost eternal hour before the baby's cry" and left us these words like "axes/After whose stroke the wood rings..."</p>Sylvia Plath (1932-1963) was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and studied at Smith College. In 1955 she went to Cambridge University on a Fulbright scholarship, where she met and later married Ted Hughes. She published one collection of poems in her lifetime, <i>The Colossus<b> </b></i>(1960), and a novel, <i>The Bell Jar<b> </b></i>(1963); <i>Ariel<b> </b></i>was published posthumously in 1965. Her <i>Collected Poems</i>, which contains her poetry written from 1956 until her death, was published in 1981 and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for poetry.</p><h2>Such is the Power of Love: Francis of Assisi as Seen by Bonaventure</h2><p>Taken from the acclaimed and best-selling Francis of Assisi: Early Documents set, this collection contains Saint Bonaventure&#x2019;s Major and Minor Legends of Saint Francis as well as his Sermons about Saint Francis.</p><p>n/a</p>
